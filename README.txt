NOTE: To run the chatbot from main.py, we recommend using the Spyder IDE (included in the Anaconda python distribution [https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install]). The ArnoldBot.py module can be run to speak with ArnoldBot directly, but users must have the NLTK libraries installed (http://www.nltk.org/install.html).
