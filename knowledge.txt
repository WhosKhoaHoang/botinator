what's that?
sounds like
the garbage man.
oh. on tuesday?
maybe they changed
the schedule.
oh, shit!
whoa!
wait a minute!
wait a minute!
hold it up, you guys.
i was afraid you'd miss me.
don't worry.
we won't.
now that
is american workmanship.
you think the japanese
invented that? bullshit.
we did. for a while,
we lost it, but we got it back.
i like cadillacs.
well, come around here, brother,
and get in this cadillac.
you'll love it.
this is style and beauty.
comfy, right? oh,
i know what you're going to say.
that's vinyl,
but you don't want leather
leather's hot,
it's uncomfortable, it cracks.
nothing but trouble.
look at the head room.
go ahead, start it up.
listen to that.
that's power
that's performance.
you know what
i like best?
what's that?
the price.
hey! wait a minute!
you can't drive
that car in here!
whoa!
 hey, guys, how's it going?
 what do you say?
working, working.
you know.
daddy, put me down!
put me down!
i surrender!
not me!
i love you, too.
here come the sandwiches.
why don't they just call him
girl george?
it would cut down the confusion.
oh, dad, that's so old.
when i was a boy and rock 'n' roll
came to east germany,
the communists said
it was subversive.
maybe they were right.
 what's in this?
 you don't want to know.
dad, what's wrong?
what's that army helicopter
doing here?
you said you wouldn't
go away again, you were through.
i'm not going anywhere.
promise?
i promise.
jackson! harris!
secure the area!
john?
john, are you in there?
john, come on out.
it's kirby.
i know.
silent and smooth,
just like always.
 i better be. you taught me.
 i'm getting rusty.
what's going on?
 jenny, how are you?
 hi.
jenny, i need
to talk to your dad, ok?
yeah? got a warrant?
very funny.
 jenny.
 ok.
john, we've got a problem.
someone's killing your men.
you gave them
new identities.
there
must have been a leak.
lawson, forrestal, bennett...
they've all been hit.
who's doing it?
you've made enemies
all over the world.
it could have been the syrians,
the south americans,
the russians,
or a terrorist group.
they'll find you.
we were going to make
a normal life here.
you will, i promise.
i'm going to coordinate
with the federal people.
we'll nail those bastards
before they get close to you.
in the meantime, jackson
and harris will stay here.
are they any good?
real good, but not as good
as you were.
is it bad?
i'm not leaving you,
if that's what you mean.
then it can't be bad.
 how bad are you hit?
 i can make it.
i've got to get my rifle
from the shed.
keep an eye out.
they'll be coming.
get downwind. the air current
may tip them off.
downwind? you think
i could smell them coming?
i did.
jenny, you go to your bedroom
and stay out of sight.
i'll be right back.
 where is she?
 mellow out, man.
we can't talk business with you
waving guns in people's faces.
your daughter's safe, colonel.
whether she stays that way
is up to you.
my people got business with you.
if you want your kid back,
then you better cooperate.
right?
wrong.
he's coming at us
with no brakes.
he's still coming,
the crazy bastard!
he'll hit us!
shit!
don't move, motherfucker
bennett, i thought you were...
dead? you thought wrong.
ever since you had me
thrown out of your unit,
i've waited to
pay you back.
you know what today is, matrix?
payday.
tranquilizers.
i wanted to use the real thing!
where is jenny?
do you remember me, colonel?
i remember you, scumbag,
especially the people
you've tortured and killed.
colonel matrix,
you do not understand...
a country like val verde.
it is a country
that needs a president...
who has an understanding
of discipline.
why tell me?
because you're going
to return to val verde,
and you are going
to kill the president...
that you helped
to overthrow me.
have bennett do it.
sounds like something
he'd get off on.
because president velasquez
trusts you, colonel.
after all, he made you
the hero of the revolution.
captain bennett left,
shall we say, under a cloud.
yeah. because he enjoyed
killing too much.
your training, matrix.
you can get close
to president velasquez.
you will kill him.
we went to a lot
of trouble to find you.
we had to pretend
captain bennett's death...
so general kirby
would become agitated...
and lead us to you.
now that i have you, you will do
exactly as i tell you.
fuck you.
daddy!
jenny!
oh, you bastards!
if you kill president velasquez,
i will send her back to you.
if you try anything else,
i will mail her to you
in pieces.
any sign of matrix?
no, sir just those bodies.
you think there's more, sir?
if he's still alive,
i'd expect a lot more.
sully will make sure
you get on the plane.
henriques will stay with you,
make sure you get off.
i don't hear from
either one of them, she's dead.
how much they
paying you, bennett?
they offered me a hundred grand.
you want to know something?
when i found it was you,
i said i'd do it for nothing.
 hey, hold it!
 i'll be back, bennett.
john!
i'll be ready, john.
we're running late, buddy.
so you and bennett
met in the service?
me and henriques
is in the service, too.
nothing like old war buddies.
well, have a nice trip, now.
take care.
oh, here.
have some beers in val verde.
it'll give everyone more time
with your daughter
you're a funny guy, sully.
i like you.
that's why i'll kill you last.
move!
hasta luego, fellas.
first class, 7 a.
and you're 7b, sir
any carryon luggage?
just him.
open your mouth again,
i'll nail it shut.
fasten your seat belt, sir
thank you.
could i have
a blanket and a pillow?
sure.
 there you go.
 thank you.
we're now preparing
for departure.
please make sure
your luggage...
is safely stored
in the overhead compartments.
fasten your seat belts
and extinguish all cigarettes.
once we reach
our cruising altitude,
we'll be serving
complimentary beverages...
and then our dinner
after that, we'll be showing
our feature film.
your flight attendants are
susan and lance, and i'm debbie.
we're here to make
your trip comfortable.
have a safe
and enjoyable flight.
excuse me.
how long is the flight?
we land in val verde
in 11 hours.
thank you.
and do me a favor..
don't disturb my friend.
he's dead tired.
upright, please.
thank you.
sir, during takeoff,
you must remain seated.
i'm airsick.
yeah, the bird has flown.
the cargo's aboard.
now go to the dropoff point.
yes. gracias, sully.
we are right on schedule.
with any good fortune,
today will be my last day
as a civilian.
your father seems
to be cooperating.
you will be together
with him soon.
won't that be nice?
not nearly as nice as
watching him smash your face in.
take her below.
yeah!
well, my 7:40 flight
to vancouver was canceled.
so, how about dinner?
yeah.
i could go to bed early, too.
 maybe another time.
 sounds like he's mad at you.
ok. well, i like you, too.
all right.
talk to you soon. bye.
love and careers. it's tough.
sounds like you need a date.
well, i don't.
girls like you meet
a lot of nice boys at airports.
listen, you're really
bugging me.
hey!
hey, slow down.
 i got something to give you.
 i'm not interested.
you don't know
what you're missing.
it looks like a nightmare.
please leave me alone!
you fucking whore.
don't move.
i'm not going to hurt you.
 step aside.
 you said, don't move.
do it. get in the car
ah!
ah!
do exactly what i tell you.
 i've got a 7:30 karate class.
 you're not going to make it.
follow him.
i knew you would say that.
don't get offended, but are you
going to kill me or something?
no.
you wouldn't tell me
if you were.
 sure, i would.
 really?
trust me.
stay close to him. faster!
that's good.
can you tell me
what this is about?
a guy i trusted for years
wants me dead.
i've only known you 5 minutes,
and i want you dead, too.
out. come on.
hurry up.
 if you're in a hurry, i can...
 i'm almost through with you.
listen to me.
my daughter has been kidnapped.
he's the only chance i've got
of finding her
if he sees me or i lose him,
they'll kill her
i need you to follow him,
tell him you're crazy about him.
bring him over here.
i will do the rest.
you go back to your normal life.
got it?
 no.
 please, help me.
you're the only
chance i've got.
she has less
than 10 hours left.
they're going to kill her
ok. all right. i'll help you.
there's this huge guy outside
in a green tshirt.
he's a paranoid maniac,
and he's kidnapped me.
i need your help.
 i'll check it out.
 thank you.
i hear you're great
with transmissions.
that's right.
oh, yeah.
this will work just fine.
biggs, are you there?
there's a guy over here
that may be wacko.
 i doubt i can handle him alone.
 i'll be there.
want to see me kick ass?
 wait here, miss.
 thank you.
attention all units.
emergency on the theater level.
suspect, 6'2, brown hair
he's one gigantic
motherfucker
this used to be a great place
for hunting slash.
it's got crowded now.
i think i found
something, though.
see you.
 what are you doing here?
 i'm waiting for my...
hey, you looking for me?
come with us.
eh!
what?
matrix.
i need a quarter
give me a quarter!
move it!
son of a bitch!
 out of the way.
 freeze!
aah!
get him!
come on.
 stop or i'll shoot!
 no!
hey, lady! stop!
wait for me!
don't you go anywhere!
who the hell are you, huh?
you steal my car,
rip the seat out, kidnap me,
you ask me to help find your
daughter, which i kindly do,
then you get me in a shootout
where people are dying.
you rip a phone booth
out of the wall,
swing from
the ceiling like tarzan,
then a cop's going to shoot you,
and i save you,
and he starts chasing me!
are you going to tell me
what's going on or what?!
no.
no? no?
oh, my god! watch out!
what are you doing?
oh, look out! aah!
this is not my day!
whoa!
whoa!
my car!
aah!
 are you all right?
 i'm dead.
you're all right.
wait for me.
where is she?
 kiss my ass.
 i can't hear you!
i'll say it louder:
get fucked.
your loyalty is very touching,
but it's not the most important
thing in your life right now.
but what is important
is gravity.
i have to remind you, sully,
this is my weak arm.
you can't kill me.
you need me
to find your daughter
open the door
cook knows.
i'll take you where i meet him.
 no, you won't.
 why not?
because i already know.
remember i promised
to kill you last?
that's right, matrix.
you did!
i lied.
aah!
now you don't have a car
now i do.
 what did you do with sully?
 i let him go.
andale!
i'm sorry
i got you involved.
tell me
what this is about.
 it's about her
 is this your daughter?
people are using her
to force me to do a job.
if i don't get to her soon,
they'll kill her
 did you do the job?
 no.
they would kill her
even if i did it.
our only chance
is to get to her..
before they find out
what i'm doing.
all that matters
to me now is jenny.
let's go. out!
stay put.
 what are you doing?
 helping you get her back.
 check the drawers.
 all right.
it's cook.
mess up the bed.
act like you had
a good time with sully.
look at this.
all right.
yeah?
 where's sully?
 in the shower
 who are you?
 room service.
open the door
move over there.
hey, sully!
oh!
aah!
you scared, motherfucker?
well, you should be.
this green beret's
going to kick your big ass.
i eat green berets
for breakfast,
and right now
i'm very hungry.
i can't believe
this macho bullshit.
fuck you asshole.
fuck you asshole.
these guys eat
too much red meat!
ah!
where is she?
cook!
let's go.
this must be cook's car
let's search it.
i think
i found something.
look at this.
what is this?
coastal is a fuel depot
that supplies planes.
to whom, the airlines?
usually smaller,
private aircraft.
are you sure?
this is where my
flight instructor gets his fuel.
there are a lot of warehouses
on pecondo street.
harris must be keeping
a plane there.
let's go.
we'll take cook's car
he won't be needing it.
this is it.
patria enterprises.
this is where i was
this afternoon.
go this way
and wait for my signal.
cindy? come on.
i've seen all the equipment,
but there's no airplane.
what about your daughter?
harris and bennett
aren't here.
she's wherever they are.
ok. look at this.
these coordinates are
somewhere near santa barbara.
longitude...
there's something going on
at this island north of here.
this must be where
they've taken jenny.
look, here's a photo
of an amphibian airplane.
 maybe they use it to fly there.
 let's look at that invoice.
type 4 fuel is amphibian.
to the island and back.
but it isn't here.
i've seen everything.
it was refueled at pump station
that's san pedro.
 how long to fly to the island?
 about two hours.
 are we going to the plane?
 not yet.
 where are we going?
 shopping.
shopping?
come on. come on!
wow!
 what's that?
 rocket launcher
go!
freeze! don't even think
about it!
 stick him in the truck.
 come on. come on.
if you call
general franklin kirby,
he will explain everything.
kirby, huh? i think
we ran him in last week.
hey.
hooker
not bad.
 what's she doing?
 she's got something for us.
i bet she does.
shit!
what the hell was that?!
jesus christ!
 where did you learn to do that?
 i read the instructions.
what time do you expect matrix
to arrive in val verde?
just over two hours.
do you think he's
going to give us any problems?
he'll do exactly as
he's told...
as long as he thinks
he'll get his daughter back.
 it's all clear
 good. ok, go.
ah!
did anybody ever tell you
you have a lot of hostility?
come on. let's move.
i hope i can fly
this plane.
oh, shit!
oh!
 oh, no!
 what's wrong?
this isn't a plane.
this is a canoe with wings.
 then get in and start paddling.
 oh!
start the engine! hurry!
ok, ok.
 this plane's older than i am!
 come on!
there's no l.e.d. readout!
i've only trained on a cessna.
 hurry up!
 i'm trying!
shit!
oh!
come on, piece of shit!
fly or die!
works every time.
all right.
here we go.
 watch out for the boat!
 we're not going to make it! ah!
 yes, we are.
 aah!
oh.
we did it. we did it.
wow!
well done.
thank you.
 matrix?
 call the federal building.
have them monitor every police,
aviation, and marine channel.
 what are you expecting?
 world war iii.
repeat: this is whiskey xray
urgent you respond.
attention
unidentified aircraft.
this is the coast guard
cutter marauder
you're flying over
the san magill gunnery range.
this is a highly
restricted area.
change course or you will be
forced to land. acknowledge.
urgent. repeat, urgent.
you must contact
general franklin kirby.
first change course or you risk
being shot down. acknowledge.
they shoot the shit
out of this area all the time.
flights out of lax
avoid it like the plague.
 can you go below radar?
 not marine radar
if i get us close to the water,
the waves can camouflage us.
 go down.
 oh... ok.
 do it!
 hang on.
we lost them, sir
slitting a little girl's throat
is like cutting warm butter
put the knife away,
and shut your mouth.
i love listening to
your little pissant soldiers...
trying to talk tough.
they make me laugh.
if matrix was here,
he'd laugh, too.
mr bennett,
my soldiers are patriots.
your soldiers are nothing.
matrix and i could kill
every one of them...
in a blink of an eye.
remember that.
are you trying to frighten me?
i don't have to try.
when matrix finishes the job,
he'll be back for his daughter
now, whether she's alive
or dead doesn't matter
then he'll be after you.
now, the only thing
between matrix and you...
is me.
it is you that is afraid,
mr bennett.
you are afraid of matrix.
of course. i'm smart.
but i have an edge.
i have his daughter
 is that it?
 that's the one.
land here. it's the most
isolated spot we'll find.
ok. here we go.
you remember the message?
commando. kirby.
code red. coordinates.
got it.
don't break radio silence
until they see me.
how will i know?
because all fucking hell
is going to break loose.
be careful, matrix.
good luck.
thanks.
mira.
s. el presidente aqui.
he was not on the plane.
kill her
como esta?
alto!
aah!
welcome back, john.
so glad you could make it.
little bitch!
i'll kill her!
yah!
commando!
i say again, commando!
this is whiskey xray 448.
i have an emergency message
for a general franklin kirby.
i repeat,
general franklin kirby.
general kirby, we have
your message on the teletype.
disparen!
paren disparando!
vayan y miren.
ah!
aah!
venganse conmigo!
aah!
aah!
jenny!
jenny!
jenny!
daddy?
jenny!
daddy?
daddy?
jenny!
daddy?
aah!
no, not daddy.
come on!
daddy.
aah!
john? how's your arm, john?
come find out.
no, thanks.
think i'll take a pass.
john, stick your head out.
one shot
right between the eyes.
i'll make it quick
for old times' sake.
stop screwing around
and let the girl go.
it's me you want.
i have one arm.
you can beat me.
come on, bennett, throw away
that chickenshit gun.
you don't just want
to pull a trigger
put the knife in me
and look me in the eye...
and see what's going on
in there when you turn it.
that's what you
want to do, right?
 i could kill you, john.
 let the girl go.
it's between you and me.
don't deprive yourself
of some pleasure.
come on, bennett.
let's party.
i can beat you.
i don't need the girl.
i don't need the girl!
ha! i don't need
the gun, john.
i can beat you.
i don't need no gun!
i'm going to kill you now!
ha!
daddy.
you're getting old, john.
you're getting old.
eeeah!
eeeah!
aaah!
john, i feel good.
just like old times.
what's it feel like to be
a dying man, john?
you're a dead man, john.
bullshit!
john, i'm not going to shoot you
between the eyes.
i'm going to shoot you
between the balls!
ah...
let off some steam,
bennett.
daddy.
move out!
 leave anything for us?
 just bodies.
i'd like you to start up
your unit again, john.
all it would take
is your coming back.
this was the last time.
until the next time.
no chance.

between the time
when the oceans drank atlantis...
...and the rise of the sons of aryas...
...there was an age undreamed of.
and unto this, conan...
...destined to bear
the jeweled crown of aquilonia...
...upon a troubled brow.
it is i, his chronicler,
who alone can tell thee of his saga.
let me tell you of the days...
...of high adventure.
fire and wind come from the sky...
...from the gods of the sky,
but crom is your god.
crom lives in the earth.
once giants lived in the earth, conan.
and in the darkness of chaos...
...they fooled crom and took
from him the enigma of steel.
crom was angered and the earth shook.
fire and wind struck down the giants
and threw their bodies in the water
but in their rage, the gods forgot
the secret of steel...
...and left it on the battlefield.
and we who found it...
...are just men.
not gods. not giants.
just men.
the secret of steel has always
carried with it a mystery.
you must learn it, little conan.
you must learn its discipline.
for no one,
no one in this world can you trust.
not men, not women, not beasts.
this you can trust.
kill that one!
the ashes were trampled
into the earth...
...and the blood became as snow.
who knows what they came for?
weapons of steel or murder?
it was never known,
for their leader rode to the south...
... while children went north
with the vanir
no one would ever know that my lord's
people had lived at all.
his was a tale of sorrow.
sit here.
sit here!
he did not care anymore.
life and death...
...the same.
only that the crowd would
be there to greet him...
...with howls of lust and fury.
he began to realize
his sense of worth.
he mattered.
in time, his victories
could not easily be counted.
he was taken to the east...
...a great prize,
where the war masters...
...would teach him
the deepest secrets.
language and writing
were made available...
...the poetry of khitai,
the philosophy of sung.
and he also came to know
the pleasures of women...
...when he was bred
to the finest stock.
but always there remained
the discipline of steel.
my fear is that my sons
will never understand me.
we won again!
this is good.
but what is best in life?
the open steppe.
fleet horse.
falcons at your wrist.
and the wind in your hair
wrong!
conan, what is best in life?
to crush your enemies, see them
driven before you...
...and to hear the lamentation
of their women.
that is good.
go. go. you're free.
go.
it has been surmised that perhaps
my lord was like a wild animal...
...that had been kept too long.
perhaps.
but whatever, freedom...
...so long an
unremembered dream, was his.
crom.
there's warmth and fire.
do you not wish to warm yourself
by my fire?
they said you would come.
from the north,
a man of great strength.
a conqueror
a man who would someday be king
by his own hand.
who would crush the snakes
of the earth
snakes? did you say snakes?
what is it you seek?
a standard.
a symbol.
perhaps on a shield.
two snakes, coming together
facing each other..
...but they're one.
with a sun and a moon below.
black sun, black moon.
yes.
there's a price, barbarian.
zamora.
the crossroads of the world.
you will find...
...what you want...
...in zamora!
oh!
crom!
food.
food!
i have not eaten for days.
and who says you will?
give me food so i have strength
when the wolves come.
let me die not in hunger..
...but in combat.
who are you?
i am subotai, thief and archer
i am hyrkanian,
the great order of kerlait.
why are you here?
dinner for wolves.
what gods do you pray to?
i pray to the four winds.
and you?
to crom.
but i seldom pray to him.
he doesn't listen.
what good is he then?
it's just as i've always said.
he's strong. if i die,
l have to go before him...
...and he will ask,
what's the rule of steel?
if i don't know it,
he will cast me away.
that's crom, strong on his mountain.
my god is greater
crom laughs from his mountain
at your four winds.
my god is stronger
he is the everlasting sky.
crom lives underneath him.
civilization, ancient and
wicked. have you seen this before?
no. let's waste no time.
it's good.
we don't know how long it was there.
stink!
does it always smell?
how does the wind get in?
how about two snakes...
...coming together over a black sun?
a magnificent standard.
the only ones i know are set's
in those cursed towers.
they've spread to every city.
two years ago, it was a snake cult.
now, everywhere.
they are deceivers.
they murder people in the night.
i know nothing.
hey.
black lotus. stygian. the best.
it better not be haga.
i would sell haga to a slayer?
a pittance to protect you from evil.
i am evil.
they're all sluts.
he's dead already.
can you believe that? huh?
you're too big to be a thief.
come. let's leave this place.
looking for snakes?
they live in the tower of the serpent.
said to have riches without end
and the greatest jewel of all...
...the eye of the serpent.
chew it slowly. it's the good stuff.
you are not a guard.
neither are you.
we're thieves like yourself.
come to climb the tower
you don't even have a rope.
two fools who laugh at death.
do you know what horrors
lie beyond that wall?
no.
then you go first.
what could smell so bad?
do you want to live forever?
that one is the high priest,
second only to thulsa doom.
they say thulsa doom's
i'll see what's here. look below.
kill them!
do you want to live forever?
all manner of pleasures
and diversions were indulged.
wealth can be wonderful.
but you know, success can
test one's mettle...
...as surely as
the strongest adversary.
they were taken to the hall
of king osric, the usurper
once a powerful northman
like my lord...
...but now old and sotted.
these are the thieves
you requested.
i thought there were three.
our companion died in the gardens.
lions ate him.
lions ate him?
the lions ate him!
you know what you've done?
rexor himself has come before me,
threatened me, the king.
what daring! what outrageousness!
what insolence! what arrogance!
i salute you.
thulsa doom. i've chafed for years
at this demigod.
snakes in my beautiful city.
to the west, nemedia, aquilonia.
to the south, koth, stygia.
snakes! everywhere these evil towers.
you alone have stood up to
their guards. and what are you?
thieves!
you see this?
they call it the fangs of the serpent.
and this one was thrust
into a father's heart...
...by his very son.
and my own daughter has fallen
under this thulsa doom's spell.
is there a dagger such as this
in her hand for me?
she follows him as a slave...
...seeking for the truth of her soul...
...as if i couldn't give it to her
as we speak,
my daughter travels east...
...to thulsa doom and
his mountain of power
she is to be his!
steal my daughter back!
take all you can carry.
there's more. there's much more.
enough to become kings yourselves.
there comes a time, thief,
when the jewels cease to sparkle...
...when the gold loses its luster..
...when the throne room
becomes a prison...
...and all that is left is
a father's love for his child.
to hell with thulsa doom.
he's evil.
a sorcerer who can summon demons.
his followers' only purpose
is to die in his service.
thousands of them.
this mountain of power where he lives
is said to be impregnable.
i have talked to subotai
and he agrees.
let's take what we have
while we live.
i have never had so much as now.
all my life l've been alone.
many times i've faced my death
with no one to know.
i would look into tents
of others in the dark...
...and l would see figures
holding each other
but i always passed by.
you and i, we have warmth.
that's so hard to find in this world.
please. let someone else pass by
in the night.
let's take the world by the throat,
and get what we desire.
the children of doom.
doom's children.
they told my lord the way
to the mountain of power
they told him to throw down his sword
and return to the earth.
ha!
time enough for the earth
in the grave.
once, great men lived here.
giants, gods.
once, but long ago.
it was here that i met my master
it was no accident.
nor is it mere chance
that i am the teller of his tale.
hey!
i'm a wizard, mind you.
this place is kept by powerful gods
and spirits of kings.
harm my flesh and you will have
to kill the dead.
can you summon demons?
yes!
i strike at you.
i summon demons more ferocious
than all in hell!
mounds have been here
since the time of the titans.
kings buried in them, great kings.
domains once glittered like
the light on the windy sea.
fire won't burn there. no fire at all.
that's why i live down here
in the wind.
you care for these places?
i sing to them,
on nights when they wish.
i sing of the tales
of battles, heroes...
...witches and women.
nobody bothers me down here.
not even thulsa doom.
do flowers grow here?
flowers?
flowers.
you're not a pilgrim, are you?
oil the sword and feed the horse.
have you ever ridden
one of those before?
no!
warrior, what are the flowers for?
for a girl.
where are you going, brother?
i'm afraid.
afraid to bare yourself?
why?
you're so big and wellgrown.
you should be proud of your body.
how can you reach emptiness
without knowing your own body?
could we talk over there
where the others cannot see?
why, yes, brother of course.
i'm afraid and i'm shy.
is this your robe, your priest's robe?
yes, it's all i have.
good.
that's all you'll ever need.
what do you see?
infinity.
good.
i see you.
i have watched you.
for 1000 years
i have watched you.
who among you still fears death?
who will not face emptiness?
infidel!
i wish to speak to you now.
where is the eye of the serpent?
rexor says that you gave it to a girl.
probably for a mere
night's pleasure?
what a loss.
people have no grasp of what they do.
you broke into my house,
stole my property...
...murdered my servants and my pets.
and that is what grieves me the most.
you killed my snake.
thorgrim is beside himself with grief.
he raised that snake
from the time it was born.
you killed my mother you killed my
father you killed my people!
you took my father's sword.
ah! must have been when l was younger
there was a time, boy,
when i searched for steel.
when steel meant more to me
than gold or jewels.
the riddle of steel.
yes! you know what it is,
don't you, boy?
shall i tell you?
it's the least i can do.
steel isn't strong, boy.
flesh is stronger
look around you.
there, on the rocks.
that beautiful girl.
come to me, my child.
that is strength, boy.
that is power
the strength and power of flesh.
what is steel compared to
the hand that wields it?
the strength of your body...
...the desire in your heart.
i gave you this.
such a waste.
contemplate this on the tree of woe.
crucify him.
he said you were a wizard.
do the gods owe you any favors?
there are dangers, but i see you care
little for those.
the spirits here ask a heavy toll.
then i will pay them.
drink.
sometime soon, perhaps tonight,
they'll try to take him.
and if they succeed
if they succeed, you'll follow.
no!
stop!
they're gone!
they're gone!
all the gods, they cannot sever us.
if i were dead and you still fighting
for life, i'd come back...
...back from the pit of hell
to fight at your side.
the old man says the
mountain of power is hollow.
thulsa doom is in the mountain.
what else does he say?
that in the back of the mountain,
there's a gorge.
many caves. a thief could get in
there, steal the princess...
...and be off before she's missed.
good thieves could do that,
but not vengeful ones.
only the girl.
we kill thulsa doom another day.
agreed?
conan?
so this is paradise!
princess.
get them!
come on!
you.
help him.
the infidel defilers...
...shall all drown in lakes of blood.
now they will know why they
are afraid of the dark.
now they will learn
why they fear the night.
seek.
the wizard.
i told him i would pay the gods.
hold me.
kiss me.
kiss me.
let me breathe my last breath
into your mouth.
i'm so cold.
so cold...
keep me...
...warm.
keep...
...me...
fire won't burn up there.
no fire at all.
why do you cry?
he is conan, cimmerian.
he won't cry.
so, i cry for him.
he will kill you.
he has seen your fires.
he will come for me,
and when he does, he will kill you.
i remember days like this when my
father took me to the forest...
...and we ate wild blueberries.
more than 20 years ago.
i was just a boy of four or five.
the leaves were so dark and green then.
the grass smelled sweet
with the spring wind.
almost 20 years of pitiless combat.
no rest, no sleep like other men.
and yet the spring wind
blows, subotai.
have you ever felt such a wind?
they blow where i live too.
in the north of every man's heart.
it's never too late, subotai.
no.
it would only lead me back here
another day.
in even worse company.
for us, there is no spring.
just the wind that smells fresh
before the storm.
where did you get this stuff?
the dead.
the gods are pleased with you.
they will watch the battle.
are they going to help?
no.
then tell them to stay out of the way.
crom...
...i have never prayed to you before.
i have no tongue for it.
no one, not even you, will remember
if we were good men or bad.
why we fought or why we died.
no.
all that matters is that two
stood against many.
that's what's important.
valor pleases you, crom,
so grant me one request.
grant me revenge.
and if you do not listen,
then to hell with you.
that's how we do it.
i did it. with my spear!
do you want to live forever?
doom!
don't leave me! my lord!
no, don't kill me!
father!
the purging is at last at hand.
day of doom is here.
all that is evil,
all that have eyes...
...your parents, your leaders.
those who would call themselves
your judges.
those who have lied...
...and corrupted the earth.
they shall all be cleansed.
you, my children, are the water..
...that will wash away
all that has gone before.
in your hand you hold my light...
...a gleam in the eye of set.
this flame will
burn away the darkness...
...burn you away to paradise!
my child.
you have come to me, my son.
for who now is your father
if it is not me?
who gave you the will to live?
i am the wellspring
from which you flow.
when i am gone...
...you will have never been.
what will your world be without me?
my son.
my son.
so, did conan return the wayward...
...daughter of king osric home.
and having no further concern...
...he and his companions sought
adventure in the west.
many wars and feuds did conan fight.
honor and fear were heaped
upon his name.
in time, he became a king...
...by his own hand.
this story shall also be told.

oculus deum.
she must be killed!
she was chosen
to bear his child.
if she lives to bring about the end
of days, there will be no redemption.
all our souls
will perish.

i'll tell you
what. you should play it safe,
not quit your job

and if the world comes to an end,
what the hell,

then we'll all have the best
time anybody has ever had.

 the thousand years has ended!
you don't know

priest that drinks.
can't be all bad.
i think the police
may want that at some point.
 they call it evidence.
 i like to get a head start.
 no reason to make it easy for them.
 yeah.
all right.
watch the lines.
go through here.
she doesn't look happy
with the statements.
should've just killed that son
of a bitch. less paperwork. yeah.
hey, detective. bobby.
hey, jer, it's been a while.
hey. how are you, marge?
can't complain. you?
it's a nice day to jump
out of a helicopter
well, just doing
my job.
now, listen. something i gotta ask you.
yeah, what is
it? you still drinking?
oh, yeah, we got
all liquored up this morning.
 we start every day that way.
 i'm just reading his statement.
you said here the guy
spoke to you. yeah. so what?
the guy doesn't
have a tongue.
 what?
 he has no tongue?
why don't i just leave
that little detail out for now.
no big deal, right? are you
saying that i imagined all this?
no, i'm just saying.
i saved a life today.
what the hell did you
do? all right, let it go.
 no, no. i know what i heard.
 all right.
those people who don't
belong here, get them out of here.
make sure this place
is secure.
a drunk hangs out in a neighborhood
bar, passes out enough times,
people would know where he
lived from carrying him home.
i mean,
it's one thing i know.
yeah, well, it's important
to be an expert at something.
oh, it took years of
research. this must be it.
what do you want
to bet it's rentcontrolled?
well, i don't think
this is paint.
a real art buff.
i don't go for this
look. it's just too damn busy.
listen to this.
i have seen the earth
laid to waste.
i have seen the horror to come. is
it a sin to wish you were never born?
the thousand years
have ended.
twenty... seven. 
it ends in a football
score. that's nice.
hey, i found something.
can you see
what it is?
his tongue.
he must have
cut it out himself.
okay. and why is it someone
would cut out their own tongue?
to keep from talking. right.
well, i could eat.
ah!
 shit!
 what?
all right, i knew
that was gonna happen.
no, it's all right.
there's something
in here.
have you ever seen her before? nah.
this guy is no ordinary hit man.
no, this one's
extraordinary.
let's get the hell outta here.
this place is making me itch.
 drop it! don't move! don't move! freeze!
 don't move! freeze!
oh. it's us.
jesus! how the hell
did you two find this place?
lucky guess. so what did you find out?
his name's thomas
aquinas. he's a priest.
why don't you tell us
something we don't know?
 a homicidal priest. that's good.
 yeah? well, it gets better
he studied at the vatican. he was
one of their alleged visionaries.
came here in '81 to st.
john's church downtown.
six months ago,
he disappeared.
priests there say he was
having a spiritual crisis.
oh, yeah.
that's what this is about.
spiritual crisis.
doesn't make any sense.
what's a priest doing shooting
at a wall street banker?
a wall street banker, by the
way, who suddenly disappeared.
maybe we should ask the girl.
what girl?
uh, the guy. the guy. priest
guy.
there's five million
women living in new york city.
how we gonna find her
without a name?
here.
look, i already gave you some
money. can you just move on, please?
he's comin' for you.
he's comin' for you, christine.
how do you know
my name?
he's gonna fuck you. he's gonna
fuck you, christine. can you see him?
 can you see him?
 who are you?
how do you know
my name?
he's gonna fuck you, christine.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
the thousand years
have ended.
thousand years have ended.
when the thousand years
are ended,
satan shall be loosed
out of his prison. 
twenty... seven. 
christine?
christine? i'll be there in a sec!
doctor's office.
hello.
is dr abel in, please?
who's calling, please?
it's christine york.
christine, listen to me.
we've been over this before.
it's a terrible thing to lose your
parents. i know it was a long time ago.
the holidays always make something
like that feel much worse.
understand, these dreams are your
creation. there's nothing real about them.
you control them.
they don't control you.
take another xanax
to relieve your anxiety.
you are fine. trust me.
another vision?
why didn't you tell me?
i didn't want you to worry. i'm your
stepmother it's my job to worry.
no big deal, really.
just someone on the subway car
turned into porcelain and shattered.
what's wrong with me? why do i
see things? why am i so different?
oh, you don't know
how special you are.
you're better than everybody
else. just remember that.
i don't want to be better or
worse. i want to be normal.
i want a normal life.
you have to have patience.
all good things will come
to you. you'll see.
oh, excuse me. i'm sorry, we're closed.
i would like to talk to
you about thomas aquinas.
father, please, i need you
downstairs. just take these.
father, please.
go.
i've already told the police. thomas
was a friend of mine and a colleague.
he had nothing to do
with what happened today.
there was no one else
on that fire escape.
you don't understand. i understand
getting shot at, and i don't like it.
he shot at you? no,
he shot at my client.
 i happened to get in the way.
 who's your client?
that's irrelevant right now. what i want to
know is why would a priest try to kill someone?
you've been drinking. i've got 14
years sober, and i can spot that.
well, good for you. your friend and
colleague, was he working for someone?
yes, he was working for god.
so god ordered a hit
on an investment banker?
there's a lot that you don't know.
you think you've seen everything?
you haven't. there are
things you never dreamed of.
there's another world out there.
thomas saw it, and it destroyed him.
i've seen a lot too, but there's nothing
that would make me cut my tongue out.
yeah, well, wait a few days.
what happens in a few days?
did thomas tell you
about a girl?
 no.
 i see. do you believe in god?
maybe once,
but not anymore.
what happened?
we had a difference of opinion.
i thought that my wife and daughter
should live, and he felt otherwise.
i'm sorry to hear about the loss. maybe
it's time for you to renew your faith.
this girl.
is she in trouble?
does she need help?
i have a lot of things to do
here. excuse me. excuse me.
i have more questions, if you don't
mind. i've got a question for you.
if you don't believe in god, how
can you understand his adversary?
now i have to believe in god
in order to solve a crime?
i'm sure that you
can find your way out.
 how many have received the stigmata?
 she's the third this week.
 what is she saying?
 for your own good, get out and forget what you've seen!
was thomas part of this? there are forces
at work you couldn't possibly comprehend!
now, please,
leave!
god rest ye, merry gentlemen
let nothing
you dismay
remember christ...
no, it's just i hate the fact that
they put finals after the holiday.
it ruins the whole meaning of vacation.
i wouldn't worry.
you always do fine.
besides, a bad grade
isn't the end of the world.
it's you.
i didn't...
where is she?
the girl is safe.
and what of the world?
everything is
as planned.
our acts go unnoticed,
unquestioned.
 we're everywhere.
 daddy, who is it?
 is this your daughter?
 yes.
 and this is your wife?
 yes.
oh, you insist
you gotta talk that shit
you gotta keep
that dog ass breath
all up in my face
and i remember when
you would never lie
to a friend
'cause you were so high
you were so shy
you were
so fucked up anyway
life keeps on tickin',
tickin', tickin', tickin'
what's wrong, baby? what's
wrong? it was a dream.
he came for me again.
it's only a dream, angel.
it felt closer
throughout
the country, the national guard...
has been put on alert
as a precaution...
mayor giuliani
urged all citizens and police...
to stay calm
during this holiday season.
no explanations for
how blood on the hands of the christ child,
depicted in michelangelo's
famous sculpture of the pieta...
...atmosphere of fear
and panic, random acts of violence...
are being attributed to satanic
cults who seem determined...
to disrupt new year's
celebrations throughout the world.
here in new york...
sorry, pal,
you can't come in here.
ahh. the young boys that you seduced
have left their scent upon you.
remember who it is
that you serve. hmm?
open your eyes, thomas.
look. look at the face that has haunted
your dreams for a thousand years.
they say you can
see the future, thomas.
then you must know exactly
what i'm going to do to you.
i don't know what
we hope to get from this guy.
he's got no fuckin'
tongue. he can write.
fuck me.
there is still no explanation...
for the devastating explosions
that rocked midtown two nights ago.
in the wake
of tuesday night's explosion,
investigators from the new york city fire
department are still at a loss to explain...
why the restaurant suddenly burst into
flames, killing at least 35 people.
 hey, asshole, watch where you're going.
 hey, i like the shirt.
screw you, man!
hey, kid.
nice shirt.
i'm tellin' you, no one entered
the room. maybe he did it himself.
then how did he get
the last scalpel in!
oh, my god.
 it just keeps getting better
 i've never seen anything like this.
i think this
is written in latin.
when the thousand years
has ended,
satan shall be loosed
out of his prison. 
uh, this next part is not clear
l ii think it's in english.
it says, christ...
christ in new york. 
christ!
well, it's official. i'm never
sleeping again, ever you okay?
a guy cuts words into his chest.
someone else nails him to the ceiling.
what's not okay?
so where we going?
the girl. i gotta talk to
her, find out what she knows.
wait. we don't have
a name. that would help.
maybe we do. maybe it's
not christ in new york. 
maybe it's, chris in new
york, christine in new york. 
christine york.  let's run a d.m.v. check
and find out if any of those names come up.
hello, christine york.
sometimes you border
on competent.
i know. it's scary, isn't it?
christine?
mabel called. she'd like you to
get dressed and join her for lunch.
grazie, carson.
ahhh! goddamn it,
get off me!
go downstairs and watch
the front door! please!
help! there is no sanctuary but heaven.
you must go there now.
 what are you doing?
 i commend you to almighty god and entrust you...
at what point
is this considered...
interfering with
a police investigation?
hey, we are private citizens having
a conversation with another citizen.
i mean, i don't think they've found a
way to outlaw that. at least not yet.
please! no!
may you return
to him who formed...
go down there. do whatever you can. i
need more time to finish the last rites.
may christ, the true shepherd...
help! stairs.
covered.
help!
may you see
your redeemer..
...forever, amen.
son of a bitch!
you all right?
yeah. check the body
down the stairs.
what body?
call the police,
and get an ambulance.
take it easy.
we're the good guys.
all right?
what happened?
carson. those men... ththose men...
they tried to kill me.
why?
eight jets, variable speed.
that's what i call dying in style.
what kind of girl lives in
a house like this, anyway?
oh, she's an orphan.
both parents deceased.
after the mother died, the
home nurse married the father
now the nurse is
the sole guardian.
i think it's adorable the
way you talk like a real cop.
yeah? so you think after they
clean up this mess, we could...
don't tempt me. soak a little?
they relax me. you want
one? oh, no, thanks. i drink.
my little girl had one
just like it. really?
mmhmm. yeah? you snoop through
her stuff without asking too?
when i was looking
for something.
what are you
looking for?
a connection.
most days, i don't feel
connected to anyone.
i noticed a lot
of religious books outside.
mm. they're
my stepmother's.
 is she a big believer?
 no, not really.
it's mostly just kind of
like a hobby with her
do you know a priest by
the name of thomas aquinas?
no. is that
your connection, religion?
i've seen a lot
of attempted murders,
but i've never seen anyone
perform the last rites before.
christine? in here!
are you all right? oh, my god,
i just heard what happened!
did they
hurt you?
i'm okay, but carson...
i know. oh.
i'm just so glad you
came along when you did.
thanks.
i didn't realize you knew where the
library was, let alone had a card.
well, there's a lot
about me you don't know.
they're right outside.
you must
bring her he is waiting for her
no, that's impossible! they'll
follow me and find the temple!
i couldn't convince her to come here.
yuck! then i shall
have to go to her
did i mention
i had a date tonight?
not just the inflatable
kind. a real live girl.
did you break up
with the inflatable one?
yeah. she was
just too needy.
everything
was about her
it's just that this is starting
to feel a lot like work.
normally, i wouldn't mind
work because, well, you know,
we'd be
getting paid.
watching rich people for free.
it just seems odd, doesn't it?
okay, i'll wait here.
 change your mind about the pill?
 i found something.
christine, what are you
doing? why is that man here?
i'll be
five minutes.
she loves me to death, but she's
a little overprotective.
i took this from one
of your attackers.
did you show that to the police? no.
if i did, it would end up in a plastic
envelope on one of their large shelves.
that's pretty cynical. well, i've
put a few of those envelopes...
up on that
large shelf myself.
i used to be a cop.
now, this amulet
is from a masonic order..
in a former subherald
of the vatican knights.
the knights of the holy see.
they await the return
of the dark angel to earth.
so, the men that attacked
me are devil worshippers?
no. this says
they're the good guys.
they're the ones that are supposed
to stop the devil worshippers.
those were the good guys? what
does that have to do with me?
i'm sorry. i have
a medical condition.
 sometimes i see things that aren't there.
 no. i saw it too.
i've been having visions
ever since i can remember,
but i've never
shared one before.
there must be
an explanation.
i hope so. i've been waiting
all my life to hear it.
let's get out of here! come on!
you're not going anywhere.
 what are you doing?
 there's no time to discuss this.
after all these years of waiting, it's
finally happening. what's happening?
you can't run away now!
 stop
it!  let her go!  no!
don't you love me?
didn't i give you
everything?
haven't i been a mother to you?
 christine. you know who i am.
 oh, no.
 i've come for you.
 let's go. come on.
you only had one simple job,
and you couldn't even do that.
hey, marge? marge, over
here! we need your help!
easy with the hardware.
jesus, marge!
what the fuck?
it's okay, jer
we just want the girl.
okay, tell me. what the hell
is going on here? i don't know.
i don't believe you.
 all right. i'm coming out.
 throw out the gun.
please don't don't
leave me here. please!
hands on your head.
 what?
 hands on your head. now!
what do you want
with her, marge? huh?
 why is she so important?
 just the girl. you can kill him.
come on!
quickly!
you, i don't need.
but you...
call your people.
find them.
over here.
goddamn it!
get up!
come on. get up!
my best friend is dead. everyone is
trying to kill us. i just shot two cops.
why is everyone after you? i don't know.
i swear i don't know.
why is this happening?
i know it's my fault.
i just don't know why.
that man on the stairs,
what do you know about him?
nothing. come on. i saw your face.
you recognized him.
i don't talk about it.
tell me. i need to know.
i've seen him before...
in my dreams.
 in your dreams?
 they're... they're nightmares really.
he takes me, and he makes love to me.
i've been making love
to him my whole life.
i thought i was crazy, but he
was never real before tonight.
oh, he's real.
i've seen him before.
 i'm afraid.
 don't be afraid. i won't let him do any harm to you.
i'm afraid of me. i'm afraid that
if i see him, if he tries to take me,
i'm gonna
want him to.
let's go!
where we going? to get some answers.
you don't need that. you have no enemies here.
i'm not so sure about that. this
girl was just attacked by your people.
 your vatican knights almost killed her!
 vatican knights?
oh, my god.
well, they're not my people. they
think they're doing god's work.
 but they're not.
 i want to know what's going on,
and i want to know right
now! put the gun away.
did anybody
see you come?
no. good. we should be safe here.
according to the scriptures, he
can't see inside of the house of god.
who can't? maybe now
you're ready to believe.
her hands are healed.
that's the power of faith.
 who is she?
 she's a polish peasant.
she fell into a trance
about two weeks ago,
and then she began to speak in a
language she couldn't possibly have known.
 she made a prophecy about end of days.
 end of days?
of man's destruction and the
unholy's reign upon the earth.
why don't you stop all this church talk
and tell us what the hell is going on.
 who's after her?
 well, if you'll excuse me, i'll try to explain.
you know anything
about the number of the beast?
revelation of st. john?
from his dream?
 sixsixsix?  the number of
the beast is not sixsixsix.
often in dreams, numbers appear
upside down and backwards.
so, sixsixsix
becomes nineninenine.
like in 1999,
the year of his return.
what does that
have to do with me?
regressus diaboli:
the return of satan.
does any of this
look familiar to you?
she's been chosen.
he's in her blood.
the holy church has been searching
for you since the day you were born.
chosen for what? every thousand
years, on the eve of the millennium,
the dark angel comes
and takes a body,
and then he walks the earth, looking
for a woman who will bear his child.
it all has to happen in that unholy
hour before midnight on new year's eve.
if he consummates your
flesh with this human body,
then he unlocks
the gate of hell...
and everything as we
know it ceases to exist.
so, the prince of darkness
wants to conquer the earth,
but has to wait until an hour
before midnight of new year's eve?
 is this eastern time?
 it's got nothing to do with new year's eve.
it has to do with a
temporary celestial alignment.
the gregorian monks
studied the heavens.
they were able to calculate the
precise moment of this event.
they created our calendar
by mapping this event...
and counting backwards
from that moment.
 it was a mistake to come here.
 it doesn't matter whether you believe or not.
he's real, and he won't rest
till he finds this girl.
 why did he pick me?
 because the stars were right when you were born.
a man's body was also
chosen, just like yours.
if the devil does exist, why
doesn't your god do anything?
it's not my god. it's our god, and
he doesn't say that he will save us.
he says that
we will save ourselves.
save myself? what am i supposed
to do? get a restraining order?
 we have to have faith.
 faith.
yes, faith.
it's an interesting concept.
if you read the bible,
you can't miss it. faith!
between your faith and my glock nine
millimeter, i take my glock. come on. let's go.
i'm afraid it takes a person of
pure heart to defeat pure evil.
you did your job. you brought her here
to people of faith. we'll protect her
 we'll hide her
 you know, you live in a different world.
we have some real serious problems
here, and this is not solving them.
satan's greatest trick was
convincing man he didn't exist.
i don't, uh... this
all feels true to me.
you'll be safer with me. at least i
can fight this guy with something real.
you know what to do.
you feel it.
i'm sorry.
let him go.
it gets easier when you
accept what you are.
a fallen soul.
tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
door's locked,
no windows broken.
 how did i get in here?
 who the fuck are you?
oh, i think
you know who i am.
you just don't
want to believe it.
i took a bullet for you.
i protected you. oh, nonono.
you didn't protect me.
you protected this body. am
i... am i getting a pattern here?
so much pain. not to
be taken with alcohol. 
remember that.
to lose a wife and child.
i can't even imagine
what that must be like.
 what do you want?
 to make you happy again.
jack
frost nipping at your nose
yuletide carols
being sung by a choir
and folks dressed up
like eskimos
a gift from you daughter? hmm?
amy? don't stay in there too
long. you'll turn into a prune.
 emily!
 come on, darling. it's time to get out.
gotta get you dressed.
your daddy's gonna be home soon.
i have the best
daddy in the whole world.
yes,
you certainly do.
but i don't
think he'll be home.
now, what makes you
say a silly thing like that?
 he never comes home.
 well, honey, you know your daddy works hard.
it's not about how much time you're
there. it's about quality time. 
now, he'll be home just
like he promised. you'll see.
he keeps his promises.
i can give it all back to you.
everything that he took away.
everything.
you can hold
your wife again.
you can watch your daughter walk
through the door in her prom dress.
all you have to do is
tell me where the girl is.
come on. she's a nobody to
you. you don't even know her
you're in the middle of something
you don't really understand.
you think you're saving her
from me? she wants to be with me.
 you know that.
 what did you do in school today?
you think i'd harm her?
i'd treat her like a queen.
turn around, sweetheart. you told me
you'd do anything to get your family back.
you want them?
this is your chance.
they're not real.
does that matter?
 oh, yes.
 i think you need to be reminded...
of how painful
reality is.
no!
oh, shit!
don't hurt my baby!
 daddy!
 let my daughter go!
daddy!
let go of my baby!
no!
oh, it's true.
it wasn't your fault.
 i wasn't there.
 no, you were just...
you were out doing your job.
 i wasn't fucking there!
 oh, look at you. torn apart by guilt.
you didn't do anything wrong. you were
an honest cop. you didn't take money.
you had to testify against them even
after they threatened your family.
most people would never
testify against those guys.
they're not like you. you
had to do the right thing.
and where was god, hmm?
he could've stopped it, but he didn't. he
fucked you. then he made you feel guilty.
me, i don't do guilt.
i didn't do what happened here.
he did. now you just think about that.
then you tell me
who's really your friend.
i can make it like
it never happened.
all for the price
of a stranger's address.
no!
you will never see the girl!
now, you see...
now you're upsetting me.
you don't want to see
me upset, believe me.
oh, you want to fuck with me?
you think you know bad, huh?
you're a fucking choirboy
compared to me! a choirboy!
you're in touch with your anger
i really like that.
i don't know about you, but
i'm going to have a drink.
you and i are
so much alike.
we're nothing alike!
nothing!
look at yourself. look at this.
look at what you are now.
you walked away from the light,
just like me. you want one?
 you need to get out, now.
 come on. you know what's in your heart.
we're on the same side. i'm not
on your side, and i never will be.
you're on his side? he's
the one who took away your family.
let me tell you
something about him.
he is the biggest underachiever
of all time.
he just had a good publicist, that's all.
something good happens: it's his will. 
something bad happens:
he moves in mysterious ways. 
you take that... that overblown
press kit they call the bible.
you look for the answer in
there, what do they tell you?
shit happens.  please.
he treated you like garbage.
you walked away.
i'm not the bad guy.
what about the end of days?
think of it
as a new beginning.
a change of management. and you'll be
right there with me on the ground floor
it will be
so cool.
tell me what you want.
tell me what you really want,
and i'll give it to you.
i'll tell you
what i want.
i want you
to go to hell.
you see,
sometimes the problem is...
hell...
comes to you!
don't fuck up the coat.
i've wasted
too much time on this.
you see those insignificant little
dots down there? huh? do you see them?
that's what you mean to me.
now, give me the girl!
not today.
look down.
now, look in your heart and
tell me you don't want to die.
all you got to do
is take my hand.
and i'll give you
back everything that he took away.
 come on.
 okay.
okay. okay. okay.
fuck... you!
hey.
hey!
 i thought you were dead.
 couple of seconds, i would've been.
all i remember is steppin' out of the
van, then i woke up in the fucking gutter
what the hell are you doing
here? what are you talking about?
i've been lookin' for you all
night. what the hell happened to you?
 hey. hey. hey.
 i can't trust you.
i don't know how much you had to drink,
okay, but let's not point the gun at me?
i just need to know.
you need to know what?
that you are you. of course i'm me!
what the hell are you talking about?
you took his body.
all right. you're ill.
okay? you need some help. all right?
oh, fuck!
jesus!
 fuck.
 you're bleeding.
of course i'm bleeding!
you fuckin' shot me!
i just needed to find
out! you found out, okay?
stop being such a pussy! it's
just a scratch. pussy? come on!
oh, christ.
does it hurt?
what do you think?
jesus.
what the hell's the matter
with you? what's going on here?
i can't explain it.
i shouldn't have left
her alone like that.
i should be with her
tell me what to do.
i gotta get back there.
got to get her as far
away from him as i can.
okay, we'll leave town. you
get her i'll get a striker car
just tell me
where to meet you.
st. john's church...
in one hour
how much longer, father?
well, he has to sire his child between
so, we must keep you hidden
until that hour passes.
we've come to help.
your eminence.
in this hour of darkness,
we need all the help we can get.
how's the girl? the girl's fine. thanks.
no.
no. father! father, they're
the ones who tried to kill me!
 no!
 your eminence, what are you doing?
we cannot allow this union
to take place. no! no.
please! you can't! you mustn't!
 let go!
 she is only one life.
how many lives are you prepared
to end if we do nothing?
 that's not who we are.
 of course it is.
we are doing god's work. we
are preventing the end of days.
but you can't prevent evil
by doing evil.
 there is no time!
 no! 
 it's the only way.
 nooo!
may god forgive us!
amen. 
i can do this all day long.
now, let her go.
you must let us finish.
if she is slain, his hope of creating
a kingdom on earth dies with her
 her death is god's will.
 it's not god's will.
it's your will, and it will
lead to our destruction. jericho.
she must be removed.
it's the only way to defeat him.
for a thousand years,
we prepared ourselves for this.
we're not afraid to die. good.
because i'm not afraid to kill you.
let her go.
go. go.
get out of here.
go!
god help us.
we're too late.
 i've come for my wife.
 let's go.
this is the house of the lord, our
god, and you are not welcome here.
i can stand the pain of being in
church. how much pain can you bear?
christine!
come to me.
i am the one
you've been waiting for
i am the answer
to your prayers.
in the name of god,
i order you to leave here now!
may the wrath of god destroy...
a thousand years you have waited for
my return. and behold, you have failed.
and with your last breath you shall
bear witness to the end of days.
no! jericho!
get in the car!
run!
jesus! come on!
bobby, what the hell are you
doing?
what are you doing?
open the door! open up!
 come on! open up!
 open the door!
jer.. please, stop the car! please!
jer!
jer!
you should
have taken my offer
at least you would have
been happy once in your life.
let her go,
or i'll kill you.
ooh, so much anger,
so much hatred.
you're almost there.
i'm gonna hurt you so bad,
you're gonna beg to die.
but i'm not gonna let you.
it's not gonna be that easy.
you're mine, and i want you
to see what's gonna happen.
world religious
leaders have asked their followers...
to prepare for the new millennium
not with celebrating and partying...
but rather with acts
of kindness, compassion...
this is it, new york.
the last day of the first 2,000 years.
 how long have i been out?
 you almost slept the whole day.
you're lucky to be alive.
the time?
it's almost 7:00.
it's not too late.
he has the girl.
but it's not too late.
in nomine patris,
et filii, et spiritus sancti.
jesus, what did you
do? get hit by a truck?
no, the truck missed me.
where the hell are you
goin'? doing my job.
you
know, the cops are after you.
they have to wait.
i've got to do something.
that son of a bitch.
yes. you wish entrance?
you have much hatred
and vengeance in your heart.
you may pass.
angelus obscurus.
princeps finis dierum.
you know
this is what you want.
angelus obscurus.
you can't resist, can you?
'cause you don't want to.
i didn't come here to hurt you.
i came here to love you.
relax.
give yourself to me.
 no one move, or i kill the girl.
 what are you doing?
 trust me.
 you're not gonna kill her
you said it yourself.
i have a dark heart.
 then stand with me.
 i'll tell you what.
you let us both out of here,
and i'll stand wherever you want.
 step back, or i'll pull the trigger
 i didn't want to kill you.
but now you
leave me no choice.
let her go, jer
oh, don't look at me
like that.
you'd be amazed what you
agree to when you're on fire.
don't do it, bobby.
you're better than this.
 you're better than him.
 you know, considering how you've lived your life,
when this is all over, what makes you
think you're going upstairs anyways, huh?
come on, jer this is the
main event. it's gonna happen.
 why shouldn't you have the best seats in the house?
 you will never get a shot off,
and you know it.
don't do it.
bobby.
i thought we had a deal?
bobby.
well, i guess
the deal's off.
no!
you son of a bitch!
here!
this way!
up here.
shit!
 oh, thank god. i thought i hit you.
 just get us out of here!
let's go.
give me a minute.
i'd feel better if you'd show me
how to use one of those things.
 i want to do something. let me help.
 all right. here.
you take the gun. line up
the sight with your target.
uhhuh. beware of the
recoil. here's the magazine.
put it in. load.
only pull the trigger when you're ready...
like that?
yeah, like that.
he's on the tracks!
shit!
 don't stop! don't stop!
 what are you doing?
he's gone.
oh, god.
go on.
 we must separate the cars. separate the cars.
 what?
jericho!
jericho!
jericho!
that's it. come on.
jericho!
here. hold on!
jericho!
how can you expect to
defeat me when you are but a man...
and i am forever!
we must lock the doors!
 deliver us, o lord.
 everyone, out!
get them to a safe place!
get them out of here!
lady, come on!
what are we gonna do?
hide. just hide!
no.
please, god, help me.
give me strength.
christine.

jericho?

you died for nothing.
you just bought them time.

i'm in kind of a hurry.
i'm late for my son's
karate class.
oh, i do apologize if i've caused you
some sort of delay.
how thoughtless of me.
the last thing i want
on my conscience right now...
...is for a private citizen
to somehow be disappointed...
...in the performance of my duty.
look, i was not criticizing you,
officer
step out of the car
that's my boy!

put up any yourself...
...i thought, why not spread christmas
cheer around the neighborhood?
gee, ted.
how thoughtful.
sorry you missed the karate class.
don't worry, i got it all
on video for you.
what would i do without you?
did you tell ted he could put
lights up on our house?
do you know what time it is?
i know. on top of the traffic
i got a speeding ticket.
don't explain it to me.
it wasn't my karate class you missed.
hi, buddy.
it's turbo time.
now's your chance to save the
universe with turbo man.
battle evil with america's favorite
superhero and his sidekick, booster
jamie...
...about that karate class tonight...
i was trying to...
jamie, stop!
listen.
it was not my fault.
don't walk away from your father
can i come in?
so, champ...
...are those hands registered weapons?
is this it?
wow! this is really cool.
how do you do this?
like this?
no, i know.
like this.
what do you think?
how about this?
i did something
really stupid today.
i don't care.
come on, jamie.
i hope that's not true, because
i really wanted to be there.
believe me.
you always say that,
and you never come anyways.
purple was important to me, dad.
that's one away from green
and three away from black.
i saw you get yellow.
but you missed blue.
you're right.
i really blew it.
i'm really, really sorry.
can i make it up to you?
like how?
like letting me
do something special...
...just for you.
if there's something important you've
been wanting for christmas...
don't worry, i got it covered.
i wrote santa.
but santa gets very busy
this time of year
sometimes he has to ask
moms and dads to help out.
no, it's not that important.
tell me.
what do you want?
i want the turbo man action figure
with arms and legs that move...
...and the boomerang and
the rocking rolling jetpack...
...and the voice activator
that says 5 different phrases...
...including it's turbo time!
accessories sold separately.
batteries not included.
i'm glad you had to think about it.
johnny's getting one
and so is everybody i know!
whoever doesn't
is gonna be a real loser
that definitely won't be you.
thanks, dad.
i love you.
i love you too, jamie.
you should have seen us.
we were bonding.
we were drawing, laughing,
talking about that turbo guy.
turbo man.
which reminds me.
you got the doll, right?
the doll?
the turbo man doll. i asked you to
pick one up two weeks ago...?
that doll. of course.
you didn't.
please tell me
you didn't forget that doll.
no, no, i...
i got it.
the turbo man doll with
those things that shoot out...
...with the rock 'em,
sock 'em jetpack...
...and the realistic voice box that
says it's turbo time. i got it.
good.
there you are.
you thought for a minute that i would
not do something you tell me.
i got it...
...right away.
good.
because at this point,
they'd probably be impossible to find.
kqrs minneapolis. we'll do the
rockin' while you fill the stockin'.
wait! hey, where you going?
i just have to run to the office
quickly. that's it.
howard, it's christmas eve.
you can't be going to the office.
i have to pick up the doll.
i left it there by mistake.
you can't go.
what about the parade?
the parade?
the holiday wintertainment parade.
you didn't go last year,
or the year before.
mom and i always go. this year
turbo man's gonna be there!
yeah, turbo man.
it's turbo time.
dad, you can't miss it.
it'll be really cool.
i won't miss it.
i'll be there.
i promise.
sorry about that, howie.
what's that, a reindeer?
a surprise for johnny.
you just think of everything,
don't you?
i believe you can never do too much
to make a child's christmas magical.
what happens to blitzen
after christmas?
i've been watching
a family of deer by the lake.
i thought i'd take him down there
and set him free.
maybe they'll take him in
like he's one of their own.
how touching.
hey, how are you?
i feel unwell with you around.
that's odd.
reindeer are usually gentle.
there's something about you
he doesn't like.
aftershave or something.
all right, got to go.
where you off to?
picking up a christmas present
for jamie.
nothing like waiting
till the last minute.
what'd you get?
one of those turbo mans.
that's great.
i got a turbo man for johnny
months ago.
it's nestled safely under our tree.
good.
by the way, they say
it may get icy later
you might want to wrap
some chains around those tires.
maybe i should wrap
some chains around you.
what?
come on.
what time do you open?
it's freezing out here.
there's 100 people...
because of two minutes? because of
two minutes you're not letting...
give the man a break!
he's a dad, trying to get a toy!
go ahead and have cuts.
last minute shopping?
enough to drive a man insane.
myron larabee.
howard langston.
i'm late because it's the
busiest time of the year for me.
christmas letters people send to
folks they talk to once a year
and relatives sending gifts
they'll send back anyway.
how many toiletry kits
does a man need? then what?
stupid letters from kids to santa!
dear santa, can you send me a bike
and a slinky?
no! your father's laid off!
as if i didn't have enough pressure,
my son sends me out...
...for some goofy toy, some fruity
robot named turtle man.
turbo man.
my son wants one too.
you know it's all a ploy.
man, don't you watch tv?!
we are being set up by
rich and powerful toy cartels!
these fat cats use the working class,
like me and you!
they spend billions of dollars on
advertisements...
...and use subliminal messages to
suck your children's minds out!
i know, i went to junior college.
and i studied psychology!
i know what's going on!
they make a kid feel like garbage
if you, the father..
...who works 24/7 delivering mail...
...to make alimony payments to a woman
who had everyone at the office...
...but me!
then the toy breaks and you can't
fix it because it's cheap plastic!
i'd like to walk up in that office,
grab one of those guys and choke him until his eyes pop out!
shouldn't wear fur
back off! i'm first!
turbo man, you're mine!
move it! move it!
get out of my way!
who wants booster?
the turbo man dolls,
they're all gone!
there must be one.
there are none!
excuse me.
yes?
i need a turbo man.
me too.
do you have any in back?
why's he laughing?
michael, these guys are looking
for a turbo man.
they're looking for turbo man.
hey, everybody, these two
are looking for a turbo man.
shut up!
yeah, what's so funny?
where have you guys been? turbo man's
only the hottest selling toy ever
but we got plenty of turbo man's
saber toothed tiger, booster
where's your christmas spirit?
that's better
there must be a turbo man
here somewhere.
the last one just left.
a lady had it on layaway.
a lady? what lady?
short...
...with a fur coat!
sorry, buddy!
give me this.
this is war
oh, poor baby!
hey, lady!
hey, hold it!
wait!
wait, lady!
i need that turbo man!
wait!
i'm turbo man.
no, i am!
you're always turbo man.
you be dementor
heck, no.
cut it out.
hi, liz.
oh, hi, ted.
it's christmas eve and you're
slaving over a hot stove.
mom of the year
it's no big deal.
and modest too.
looks like you could use
some you time.
go upstairs, take a bath. i'll watch
the boys, finish up with the cookies.
go on.
you deserve it.
well, okay, but, you know...
i know, sugar cookies.
bake 1 2 to 1 5 minutes...
...till golden brown.
ted's got everything under control!
pipe down in there!
merry christmas!
langston residence.
howard! how's it going out there?
everything okay?
fine. i need to speak to liz.
could you get...?
excuse me, but your wife's cookies
are out of this world.
what? who told you
you can eat my cookies?
i'm just helping liz out a little
in the kitchen.
i need to speak to my wife, so could
you get her on the phone, please?
she may be showering, should i check?
no!
i mean, no. it's fine.
on your way out, tell her
i will be a few minutes late.
but she shouldn't worry.
she won't. i mean, i'm here already.
oh, these cookies! i gotta get
the recipe from liz.
put that cookie down!
now!
is something bothering you?
at christmas there's
a high incidence of breakdowns.
there's the next batch.
i'll give liz your message.
hey, look who it is!
still on the hunt?
sorry about whacking you.
got caught up in the friendly
spirit of competition.
that's all right.
i was thinking you'd have
done the same thing.
then i realized we're the same
kind of person.
i doubt that.
outside of the brouhaha in the store,
we could form a team.
you know, like starsky and hutch.
like lke and tina.
maybe we could do it!
search and destroy. divide
and conquer! what do you say?
thanks, myron...
...but no, thank you.
let's do it, man!
let's be a team!
gee, myron, i think
you're a good guy and all...
...but this i would like
to do by myself.
you understand...
...right?
i understand you!
i know what's going on.
mister, with your fancy cashmere coat
and little suede shoes.
i was good enough to talk to in line,
but not to be on your team!
that's racism! that's what
jesse jackson talks about.
they got a delivery of
turbo man at toy works!
turbo man!
turbo man!
piece of junk!
officer..
you broke my little mirror
license and registration, please.
is there a problem, officer?
listen up, people!
as to your first question: yes!
the rumors are true.
we have received a small quantity
of the turbo man action figure.
i'm not going to ask you people
to be quiet again!
here's how this will work.
form an orderly line so an employee
can hand you a numbered ball.
these balls...
...will then be drawn in lottery
fashion to see who gets a doll.
if you're not one of them...
...we have plenty of turbo man's
pet tiger, booster, in stock.
we don't want it! we don't want it!
who wants booster?
in accordance with the laws
of supply and demand...
...the price of each
figure has doubled.
i got it! i got it!
he maced me!
i got it!
i got it! i got it!
he got two! he got two!
get the mailman!
get him!
he's lying!
that's my ball!
rodney king! rodney king!
this is my ball. stay.
hi, little girl.
look what i've got.
a shiny red ball.
want to trade?
give me the ball!
sicko! pervert!
get your hands off my kid!
i need the ball!
i need that toy!
i need that toy.
pervert!
i'm not a pervert!
i just was looking for
turbo man doll!
hey, come here.
come here.
you want a turbo man?
forget it. i'm not
gonna sit on your lap.
that's not my bag. get it?
you know, little boy,
with your attitude...
...i don't think i'll
give you access to this.
tony, show him.
that was taken this morning.
how do i know this isn't a scam?
forget it, tony.
he doesn't want our help.
wait a minute, guys.
we're businessmen. i'm sure
we can work out an agreement.
you got cash, we got the doll.
how much?
merry christmas!
a merry christmas to you.
are you crazy?
santa doesn't deliver
in broad daylight.
excuse me. i may be wrong...
...but you're not the real santa.
really? and you're not the kind
of guy who's got enough foresight...
...to get his kid a turbo man
before christmas eve.
show a little respect
for the suit, huh?
do you want the doll?
come on, i got a parade to go to...
...and i haven't yet seen
this turbo man doll.
hang a left.
he's a little boy
who santa claus forgot
beautiful.
up here.
i love this time of year
christmas carols...
...snowflakes, santa clauses.
now what?
are you dan rather?
what are you, the question king?
chill.
all right, keep your hands
where i can see them.
password.
jingle bells, batman smells.
i know what you're thinking.
oh, no.
you have no idea.
tony, get the man his turbo man.
got it.
i gotta tell you, santa...
...there's something here
that doesn't seem quite...
...kosher
kosher?
this, coming from a guy who assaulted
a toddler for a superball?
listen, we provide a service here.
we don't do this for us.
we do it for the kids.
for the kids?
for every kid who ever
sat down on santa's lap.
every little girl who left cookies
and milk for santa on christmas night.
every boy who opens a gift christmas
morning and finds clothes...
...instead of toys.
it breaks my heart.
there it is.
that'll be 300.
dollars?
no, chocolate kisses!
yes, dollars!
i can't believe this.
what happened to your lofty ideals?
i thought you did this for the kids.
well, sure.
i don't see why we can't make
some money in the process.
take it.
count it.
put it in the safe.
don't open that up!
well, that's
the multilingual version.
it's fun and educational.
i wouldn't...
of course,
there's some assembly required.
let me get that.
put it in the box.
forget it. give me the money back.
all sales are final.
you know what you are?
nothing but a bunch of sleazy
con men in red suits.
what?
you heard me.
con men, thieves, degenerates,
lowlifes, thugs, criminals!
in the north pole,
them are fighting words, partner
put 'em up!
relax, buddy.
i'm not about to hit a santa claus.
are you chicken?
get him!
shut up!
i'm gonna deck your halls, bub.
little buddy!
you're a naughty boy!
who's gonna be next?
dog pile!
it's the grinch!
scatter!
who are you?
hey, buddy!
this is the sloppiest bust
i've ever seen in my entire career
detective lang, undercover
i've been working on this case
for the last 3 years...
...and you come barging in here like a
bunch of terrorists at a tea party!
wait till the commissioner finds out.
he's going to hit the roof!
now get your act together
and arrest someone!
go!
i'm not going back to the joint!
put them in the van and lock them up!
come on.
come on, not now!
you're so considerate,
bringing all this holiday cheer
christmas comes but once a year
you're an amazing man, ted.
i wish every husband
was more like you.
thanks. we should get together
and swap recipes.
what's the reindeer's name?
i named him ted, after my dad.
your dad is so cool. i wish
my dad did stuff like this.
he never used to. not until
he and my mom split up.
really?
maybe your parents should get
a divorce. did wonders for my dad.
hot chocolate?
how you doing, buddy?
hi, dad. i knew you'd call.
let me talk to your mom.
you can't.
why not?
she's next door petting ted.
she's what?
are you on your way?
the parade's gonna start soon.
get your mother
are you?
am i what?
coming home soon?
yes, immediately.
now please get your mother
before you left, you promised
that you'd be at the parade.
you haven't been here all day,
so you can't miss it.
jamie, please...
'cause when someone makes a promise,
they should keep it.
it's like what turbo man says:
always keep your promises if you want
to keep your friends.
enough!
enough of this turbo man, okay?
i've had it up to here.
if there's anyone i don't
want advice from, it's turbo man!
now, get your mother
i'm sorry, jamie.
look...
what would you know about
keeping your promises? you never do!
you never do anything you
say you're going to do!
ever!
damn you, howard.
here you go, my man.
this'll warm you up.
cheers.
you!
peace.
'tis the season to be jolly.
right.
any luck finding the doll?
no.
me neither
maybe this will help.
what the hell?
so i couldn't find the kid a doll.
does that make me a bad father?
no.
but yelling at him
for no reason...
...that makes me a bad father
we get one chance a year to prove
we're not screwups and what happens?
we screw it up.
i remember a few years ago...
...i wanted to do something
special for jamie.
so...
...i built him his own clubhouse.
it came out great.
well, i mean, the door
was a little crooked, right?
and the roof wasn't straight,
but you should've seen his face.
when he saw that, he was so excited.
we played in the clubhouse all day.
he even made us have dinner in it.
i was the hero then.
look at me now.
he's gonna need serious therapy, man.
don't say that.
i know what i'm talking about.
see, i never forgave my father
one christmas i wanted a special toy:
johnny7 oma gun.
you remember those?
i remember the commercial.
two kids playing in the back yard.
johnny to peter, enemy sighted.
roger there. open fire.
then johnny whips out his
johnny7 oma gun. seven guns in one.
thing looked like a blast.
but, of course, with my old man...
...christmas was just another
opportunity to let me down.
i never got the johnny7 oma.
sorry to hear that.
don't mean nothing.
ever heard of scott sherman?
yeah, ceo of sherman industries.
he was my old neighbor..
...and his dad
got him a johnny7 oma gun.
you know what happened?
he became a billionaire.
and me...
...well...
...i am just a loser..
...with no future.
here's to you, dad.
i can't let this happen.
it's just a doll.
it's just a stupid
little plastic doll.
action figure.
there's gotta be one somewhere!
you say you've been looking
everywhere for a turbo man doll?
you say you'd do just about
anything to get one?
kqrs has good news for you.
if you're the first caller to
identify santa's reindeer..
...you'll get the hottest toy since
johnny7 oma.
dasher, dancer, prancer, vixen, comet,
cupid, donner, blitzen.
i don't think so, buddy.
come on.
give me the phone.
give me the phone!
come on, answer it.
kqrs, hello.

i got...
...the answer

dasher, dancer, prancer, vixen,
comet, cupid, donner, blitzen!
i couldn't get you on the phone.
did i win?
i won! i won!
no! wait, wait, wait!
too late. i already got
the right answer i won.
i don't need the answer to win!
i got this!
what's that?
this, mr track star,
is a homemade explosive device!
a bomb?
yes, in layman's terms...
...a bomb! so back up!
you built a bomb?
i didn't have to.
don't you read the news?
these things come through
the mail every day! i kept one.
so give me the doll,
or i'll blow everyone up!
are you crazy? put this thing away!
it's not worth it!
to me it is! so back up!
back up!
come on, buddy.
give me the package.
let's have it.
did you call me buddy?
i'm not your buddy!
i tried to be your teammate! your
friend! but no, you had other plans.
i had no plans.
you are no different than the rest!
those letter writers who make fun
of my knee socks in the summer!
are you laughing at me?
no, lord, no. not at all.
mr ponytail man, i know you!
i know your kind!
you put a trash can in front of the
mailbox so i gotta get out of my jeep.
no! i recycle.
shut up!
yeah, shut up!
why's the window there?
so i can just put the mail in!
but you act like everything's okay!
hey, mr mailman!
like i have no feelings of my own!
hit the deck!
i'm sorry.
i've been under pressure.
don't hit me! i got sickle cell!
are you under the impression i have a
turbo man doll here in the studio?
yes.
that's what you said on the radio.
yes, you did.
no, no!
what i actually said was whoever won
would get a doll...
...eventually.
you see, what we have here...
...is a gift certificate.
a gift certificate?!
right.
a certificate for a doll when
they get some in the stores.
did you call the cops?
kind of.
let's get out of here.
but i'm first!
better luck next time, loser!
freeze!
just can't stay
out of trouble, can you?
don't hurt a fellow civil servant.
all this violence!
it's christmas, and i was
just delivering some...
back up! this is a
homemade explosive device.
i'll blow it up!
i work for the post office,
so you know i'm not stable!
tell them!
this man is totally insane.
thank you! now put the guns down.
now!
brother, put your gun down!
everybody!
you too, barnaby jones.
just stay there.
i'll know if you move, because i have
the ear of a snake!
ciao, baby.
you shouldn't touch that.
relax, sparky...
...i was on the bomb squad
for 10 years.
i'm the man! i'm the man!
gentlemen...
...we've been duped.
this is nothing but a
harmless christmas package.
that was really a bomb?
this is a sick world
we're living in!
how many years in the bomb squad?
thanks a lot.
that son of a...
what are you doing?
your star wasn't up.
it's christmas eve, it has to be up.
i'm out all day...
...and he's in my house...
...putting up my star..
...on my tree.
i got a turbo man for johnny
months ago.
it's nestled safely under our tree.
nestled safely under our tree.
safely under our tree...
i'll show him.
i'm sorry, ted,
but that's howard's job.
he puts the star on.
he's adamant about it.
too bad he's not adamant about
being with his family...
...on christmas eve.
it's turbo time!
liz, do you hear that?
carolers.
let's go. come on!
we wish you a merry christmas

it's not what you think.
it isn't? really?
then tell me. you said you got
jamie a turbo man weeks ago.
it looks like you broke into
ted's house and stole presents!
if you give me a second,
i could explain it.
i know parts of this are going
to sound completely ridiculous...
...but let me tell you the truth.
i've been listening to your version
of the truth for far too long.
all i want is to salvage what's
left of christmas eve...
...and go to the parade with my son.
liz, please...
would you drive us?
of course.
you can't benchpress
your way out of this one.
oh, god.
you picked the wrong day.
you started it.
mom, do you think dad's
going to be at the parade?
i wouldn't count on it.
turbo man's gonna be there.
you can always count on him.
hey, rudolph, can i
buy you another round?
sorry, buddy...
...but you're on your own.
it's time i start
keeping my promises.
it's that time of year again.

liza tisch of am live.

and listen.
the parade's already started!
there's owen and his dad.

while you park the car?
please?
we'll meet you there.
and don't go wandering off.
jamie, put on your hat.
i know.
check it out!
you see turbo man?
no, they're saving him for last.
this is awesome!
cat in the hat!
can't you take 4th street?
sorry, the roads are packed.
everyone's going to the parade.
turbo man's gonna be there.
i know.
i'm sorry you had to go
through that back there.
here, have some
nonalcoholic eggnog.
i'll be fine.
you can't hide your feelings from me.
let it out.
get it out of your system.
no, really, ted, i'm okay.
i don't think so.
you're like a lost, frightened foal.
i can see it in your eyes.
don't worry.
ted's here.
that's...
...very sweet.
you deserve better, lizzie.
lizzie?
someone you can talk to.
a shoulder to cry on.
it's useless, liz. we can't
hide our feelings any longer
feelings?
i don't have to tell you...
...i am very eligible bachelor
lots of women would give anything
to be in your position.
well, i'm a lucky, lucky girl.
for me, it all started
months ago...
...at your labor day
barbecue, remember?
and you asked me
how to marinate ahi tuna?
and i said, all you need
is italian salad dressing.
you!
stop that man!
enough talking.
that didn't go
as well as i'd hoped.
you!
who are you? are you the guy?
thank god. we got him, people!
listen. we're running late,
so pay attention.
we sent you an instruction manual
so you know the important controls.
i'll go over the changes. there are
three cutoff valves to the nitro.
here, here, here.
the reading on the pressure
gauge should be below 50.
not 70, like we told you earlier
the emergency cutoff is here.
the primary controls are here.
there's a microphone inside the
helmet to alter your voice properly.
procedure wise, it's
the same as we talked about.
stick to that,
there'll be no problems.
questions?
before you say anything,
i speak for everyone...
...when i thank you for filling in.
it was a total freak accident,
what happened at rehearsal.
we're confident we got
all the kinks out.
you should know the doctor said pete
showed some brain activity today.
that's a really good sign.
let's move it out, people!
finally!
where the hell have you been?
i've been sweating like a dog
in a chinese restaurant...
...waiting for your
sorry ass to show up!
well...
...it's showtime!
i know you.
you're booster
and who the hell do you think
you are, mary poppins?!
come on, come on, let's go!
wait. let's talk!
have a great show!
and now...
...the moment you've all
been waiting for!
live and in person...
...turbo man!
wave, you idiot!
wave!
this is cool.
look, mom, it's turbo man!
i could get into this.
in a few moments turbo man will pick
a special child from the audience.
that child will be the winner of a
special edition turbo man doll.
you're supposed to be
holding this.
hey, rock star!
be on your toes. dementor's gonna
jump on the float soon.
what's he doing?
would you pick a kid already?
pick a kid?
pick a kid so he can come
up here and get his prize!
pick me! pick me!
over here!
he's looking at me.
no, me.
he's pointing at me.
no, me.
me!
me!
jamie.
he knows my name!
i think turbo man
has selected a winner
go ahead.
go, jamie!
merry christmas, jamie.
how did you know my name?
well, jamie...
...you see...
...i am your fa...
oh, no, kids!
it's turbo man's archenemy...
...dementor!
shut up!
was that in the script?
all right, give me the doll
and nobody gets hurt!
myron?
that's right, turtle man.
thought you could outsmart me?
thought your suit idea
was so slick!
but you know what?
i'm one step ahead of you
because i have a bigger brain!
just stay here.
come on, myron.
you're taking this too far
i'm not going home
without that doll!
hey, this ain't
the way we rehearsed it!
you know what?
nobody likes you, booster
we don't like you!
we hate you, booster!
where are you going?
come back, my little pretty,
and your little doll too!
hey, myron!
leave him alone!
tata, turtle man!
uhoh, liza! it looks like
dementor has beaten turbo man.
this could be the end
of civilization as we know it.
do something, turbo man!
use your turbo disks!
my what?
on your arm!
hey, man! i have a
special delivery for you!
it appears that turbo man
has saved the day.
i'll take you back to your mom.
go, demon team!
it's the demon team,
dementor's evil henchmen!
what'll you do now?
what about my son?
don't you know the choreography?
i ain't through with you!
get out of my way!
come here.
i'm sorry i hollered!
get out of my way!
get out of my way!
come here, boy!
get this popcorn away!
you know what?
you need a timeout.
don't worry, it's part of the show.
stay on the sidewalk.
that's my son.
oh, he's wonderful.
he's not part of the show!
i'm scared of heights.
you ever see the movie vertigo?
let's get him!
i want to talk to you!
all right, kid, end of the line!
give me the doll!
never!
fly, turbo man! use your jet pack!
it's turbo time!
i think i'm getting the hang of this!
turbo man, help!
i got you!
out of my way!
let us pray.
i got you, kid!
give me the doll.
turbo man!
use your turborang!
come on!
missed me!
victory is mine!
vlctory!
i got it! i got one!
i finally got one!
turbo man! help!
got you!
thanks, turbo man.
i knew you'd save me.
you can always count on me.
awesome!
here you go, ma'am.
did you see that?
i was flying with turbo man!
he saved me from dementor
it was the coolest! did you see?
i saw. i saw.
thank you. you don't know
how much he means to me.
oh, i think i have an idea.
what's the matter?
it's just... i wish dad
could've been here, you know?
to see me fly and all.
but he didn't come.
and it's all my fault.
he's mad at me.
we had a fight on the phone
and i kind of yelled at him.
your dad is not mad at you.
he loves you more
than anything in the world.
you're his all time
favorite person!
how do you know that?
well, who would know better than...
...me?
dad?
howard?
right here.
you two mean more to me
than anything.
i'm sorry i haven't
shown that lately.
i know i've been
neglecting both of you.
but no more.
i love you. i love you both!
what's going on here?
jamie's dad is turbo man!
let's get out of here!
you smell like barf!
young man, i have something
that belongs to you.
thanks!
you're welcome.
as for you...
...we could use
a man like you on the force.
thanks.
i'll keep that in mind.
i'm sorry about the bike.
and the coffee.
and the bus.
and the...
...bomb.
bomb?
i had it right here in my hands.
what do i tell my son
on christmas morning?
how will i look him in the eye?
wait!
did you see? i had it!
i was so close.
merry christmas.
thank you. thank you!
this'll make my son really happy.
i'm sorry about that
tension on the roof.
it's cool.
but, jamie, i thought you wanted
this doll more than anything.
what do i need the doll for?
i got the real turbo man at home.
turbo man!
that's my husband.
turbo man!
that's my dad!
that's my dad!
look at that. there it is!
beautiful.
perfecto!
i've been thinking.
everything you went through today
shows how much you love jamie.
and if you're willing to go through
all of that just for a present...
...that makes me wonder..
what?
what did you get me?

excuse me.
shithead.
you shouldn't be here.
i know. ask for
at least $1,000, okay?
i'll get as much
as i can. you hide.
his wife took his kid
and a couple of million...
and we won't
get a thousand.
shut up
and stay hidden.
i told him
i was coming alone.
hey, mr crisp.
how's it going?
you said you had information
about my family.
yeah, yeah, i do.
well, let's have it.
well, it's going to cost you.
like $1,000?
okay, that's obviously
not my final offer
i mean, more than fine.
just tell me what
you have, danny...
and i'll take
good care of you.
okay.
that sounds fair
i was doing a delivery
for corky last week
out of state...
and i ran into your ex.
how'd she look?
she looked great,
mr crisp. yeah.
she changed her hair
and stuff...
but she looked like
a million dollars.
in fact, she looked like
about $3 million.
did she see you?
no. i was
changing a tire...
and suddenly, there she was
across the street...
taking her kid
into this school.
my boy?
looked great.
he looked very healthy.
it's a real nice, healthy place
where they're living.
it snows in winter there.
danny...
where are they?
at the school
where i saw them...
astoria elementary school.
that's...
it's in astoria, oregon.
all right.
did you tell
anyone else this?
no.
no way.
hey, i'm not stupid,
mr crisp.
you're not?
danny.
danny! no!
danny!
danny!
get up!
don't you die on me!
i didn't kill him.
i didn't kill him.
was it crisp?
i don't know.
i didn't see anything.
what are you doing?
hey, hey, hey!
stop it! don't do that!
don't go anywhere.
let me go!
no! let me off of him!
i don't like
what you've done.
i really don't like it.
it feels terrible,
and it looks dreadful.
i'm trying my best.
maybe your best
isn't good enough.
i'm back.
oh, great.
well, that was fast.
it was easy.
i have some great, exciting,
wonderful news, mother
oh, you always
exaggerate, cullen.
everything is always
great, terrific.
so, what's so great?
i just found out
where they're hiding.
are you serious?
you really know where he is?
manicure, mr crisp?
oh, how could i
say no to you?
tell me.
what's happened?
just let me
handle this myself, mother
i know what i'm doing.
everything is under control.
it's all right.
i'm a police officer
crisp, you're under arrest.
put your hands on your head
and get up!
kimble, not again!
your hands!
they're up.
when will you
leave me alone?
drop the gun!
drop the gun!
hey, i'm a police officer
this is an arrest.
this man's crazy.
look at him.
he'll kill me.
you're just going to stand there?
freeze!
i'm a cop!
i'm detective john kimble.
this man is under arrest.
i'm checking.
you can't just walk in here
and put a gun in my face.
i'm trying to get a manicure.
i have witnesses.
i have a witness, too.
it's murder one this time.
now you're mine.
the bastard handcuffed me
to a dead man!
a dead man!
come on. sit down.
now, did danny ever say
what crisp's wife looked like?
no.
did he ever say what name
she was using in oregon?
he didn't say anything.
look, i just
want to go home.
after the lineup,
i'll drive you home.
i'll even buy you dinner
i'll even cook you dinner
i'm not doing any lineup...
and there ain't jack shit
you can do about it!
i've been after crisp
for four years...
and she's letting
my key witness walk away?
kimble, sit down!
sit down.
 sit.
 sit.
now listen to me.
he killed your boyfriend.
all you have to do
is point your finger..
and we can put him away
for 30 years.
he wasn't my boyfriend.
i hardly knew the guy.
i know you're in there.
i know what you want,
but you ain't getting it.
no lineup, no testimony.
so shove your handcuffs
up your ass!
now let me out of here!
slow down!
open it and let me out!
o'hara, meet kimble.
kimble's been on this
a long time.
hi.
let me take care of cindy.
she'll make crisp.
i guarantee it.
what are you going to do...
handcuff her to your car
and take her for a ride?
i'm not going to offer
to cook her dinner
kimble, hold on a second. l...
difficult man.
got to get to know him.
oh, i can't wait.
hey, baby.
what you mean, hey, baby?
dnde vas?
shit!
oh, excuse me.
i forgot to introduce myself.
my name is john kimble...
and i love my car
i'll keep an eye
on it for you.
you got a beautiful ride.
shit. who does
he think he is?
he's lucky i didn't
kick his ass.
open up.
you can't come in.
thank you.
what the fuck?
all right...
party's over
everyone go home.
next time, my place.
so who are you, man?
shit!
i'm the party pooper
hi, cindy.
do you mind if i sit down?
no.
sit down, man.
oh, it's so nice
to see you again.
what are you doing here,
you asshole?
cindy, i don't like you
using foul language...
not a classy girl
like you.
don't you have
anything better to do?
you don't understand.
i have nothing else to do...
and i have nowhere else to go.
why are you staring
at me like that?
i like you, cindy.
i'm going to be
around you a lot...
days, nights,
weekends, holidays.
no.
no, you can't.
yes, i can.
i'm going to
hang out with you
until the end of time.
all right, move it in. let's go.
step onto the numbers.
face front.
everybody, hands to your side.
that's the creep.
who?
number five.
that's him.
good.
very good.
mr crisp, you will be
remanded into custody
until your trial.
bailiff, remove the prisoner
shh. don't say anything.
just take it easy.
i'll take care of it.
trust me.
you know what to do?
i'm your mother, aren't i?
mind if i talk
to my friend a little bit?
i'm not talking to anybody
without my lawyer
he's right in here.
you give me the names
of your drug suppliers
and distributors...
and i'll tell the judge
what a nice, cooperative killer
you are.
you think the jury's
going to convict me
on the testimony
of that junkie?
you could be right.
but what about your wife?
you remember her?
all that hard earned drug money
she stole from you?
how much was it...
$3 million?
i bet she would make
a much better witness.
kimble, you've wasted years
chasing after me...
and what has it
gotten you, hmm?
nothing.
i'll be out in a week...
and you'll still be
eating takeout food
in that dump you live in.
yeah, i know all
about you, kimble.
without me, you wouldn't
even have a life.
my old lady left
'cause of the money.
yours left because she just
couldn't stand the sight of you.
i've never seen anyone
so little
eat so much.
yeah, i know.
i'm hypoglycemic.
if i don't eat regularly...
i get a little nuts.
so... where you from?
austria.
how long you been a cop?
i been a cop for 12 years.
my father was a cop...
my brother was a cop...
my mother was a cop's wife.
and i have no hobbies.
you two are booked on the first
flight to portland tomorrow.
locate crisp's wife
and offer her immunity
in exchange for
her testimony against him.
no offense to o'hallahan...
but this is my case,
and i work alone.
he works alone.
not anymore.
she's going in undercover
as a substitute
kindergarten teacher
not exactly a job for you.
i used to be a teacher
we'll be fine.
what do i do?
she locates the kid...
you find the mother
and the cash...
and crisp spends his life
making license plates.
bon voyage.
oh, and, kimble,
the name's o'hara.
ok. here's the wife at 17.
real name's rachel myatt.
she's from hannibal, missouri,
class of '76.
cheerleader, first violin
in the school orchestra...
captain of the girls'
softball team.
her ambition was to travel...
experience life...
and meet interesting people.
like crisp.
okay.
relax.
don't let him get to you.
that's her 10 years later
it's a great shot of an ear
you get in touch
with her parents?
they're both dead.
the only relative
she's got left is the kid.
hey.
okay. this is the only picture
we have of him.
cullen jr, aged 3 months.
that helps much.
it's the best i could do.
breakfast, sir? ma'am?
please.
no. no, no.
that's a first.
listen, i was
just thinking.
maybe we should
take a wild stab
at getting to know each other
before we have to pretend
we're married.
what do you want to know?
how long have we been married?
a long time.
people won't expect us
to talk much to each other
i want to read it, too.
stop it.
please?
let me take a look.
hey, come here.
if you don't stop
screwing around back there...
this is what
i'll do with you.
ohh.
what's the matter?
i don't know.
i just don't feel so good.
you hungry?
i got to get out
of here right now.
get those tree stumps
out of my way
before i vomit all over them.
is your wife okay, sir?
compared to what?
maybe it was the burrito.
or it could've been the sausages.
i don't think it was
the crab salad.
it couldn't
have been the doughnuts.
excuse me.
oh, i hate feeling like this.
i hate it, too.
uhoh.
uhoh what?
uhoh...
pull over
now?
yeah. please hurry.
the key!
give me the key!
do you need a hand?
you okay?
i'm fine.
i'll be fine.
class starts
at 9:00 in the morning.
i'll be fine.
you look much better already.
oh. kindergarten, 6-year-olds.
that's why i quit teaching,
you know.
i got so sick
of other people's kids.
i was afraid that
i'd never want to have any
of my own.
i have a son.
he's 13.
i remember
when he was 5.
he lives with his mother
and stepfather
aah!
what's the matter?
what...
is...
that?
oh, excuse me.
i forgot to tell you.
this is my ferret.
he doesn't bite.
don't worry.
come on.
come on out.
this is all i need...
an obstacle.
a goddamn obstacle.
he sends me an obstacle.
here.
oh, god.
don't worry.
i'm going to make it.
i just need a minute.
i'll be ready
in just a minute.
i just got...
oh, god.
how do i look?
take off the gun.
that's a good idea.
the little bastards
are going to eat you alive.
get some rest,
and don't worry.
i've been working undercover
for a long time.
they're 6-year-olds.
how much trouble
can they be?
on second thought...
take the gun.
matthew...
i sent you to
the principal's office
because you punched jenny.
i know. she poisoned
your hamsters.
she told me all about it...
and she's very sorry.
and i'm sorry that
i didn't believe you.
 but you shouldn't punch people.
 but she...
mr kimble, miss schlowski
will see you now.
let's go back to class.
can i help you?
i'm john kimble,
your new kindergarten teacher.
we were expecting
a miss o'hara.
there's been
a change of plan.
four weeks into
the new semester..
my superintendent told me
i had to replace mrs. hagley...
a kindergarten teacher
of 25 years' experience...
with an undercover
police officer..
and he wouldn't even tell me why.
i don't suppose you
would do me the courtesy
of filling me in.
i can't do that.
oh.
you can't do that.
i'm watching you.
all i have to do
is tell my parents
that you're
with the police...
and they'll yank their kids
out of this school so fast...
we'd have to close.
and don't you think i won't
if i feel my children
are in any danger
they're not in danger
i assume you have
some teaching experience.
they wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.
just wait here a minute.
everybody sit down
on the carpet!
good morning, everyone.
good morning, miss schlowski.
your teacher, mrs. hagley
had to go on
an important trip.
where'd she go?
that doesn't matter
did she die?
no, lowell.
she went to see someone.
did they die?
no, lowell.
everyone dies, you know.
i know, but not
for a long, long time.
now, until mrs. hagley
comes back...
we have someone special to help.
this is mr kimble...
your new kindergarten teacher
now, let's everybody say,
good morning, mr kimble.
good morning, mr kimble.
good morning.
they're all yours.
i'll be watching you.
hi.
how are you?
i'm very happy to be here.
first i would like
to just get to know you.
quiet.
i'm going to ask you
a bunch of questions.
i want to have them
answered immediately.
how many of you
were born in astoria?
raise your hands.
let's see them.
okay, hmm.
now, anyone that was not
born in astoria...
somewhere outside
like california...
raise your hands.
yes.
i need to go
to the bathroom.
okay. you can go.
boys have a penis.
girls have a vagina.
thanks for the tip.
yes?
i need to go
to the bathroom...
and i can't get
these things off.
i'll get someone
to help you.
i'll be right back, okay?
you've learned that
the e is often silent
when it immediately
follows another vowel.
now write and say
these words...
oh, um...
class, uh, catherine...
can you take over
for me, please?
thank you.
e is the fifth letter
of the alphabet.
yes, can i help you?
i have a problem.
mr kimble...
i need to go real bad.
first day?
yes.
i'll take care of her
thank you.
you know, kindergarten
is like the ocean.
don't turn your back on it.
they're okay.
don't worry.
everything is under control.
no.
monsters.
what are you doing with this?
aren't you going
to break it up?
no. two more days of this...
and he'll quit.
shut up!
shut up! shut up!
shut up.
no.
don't start this.
aah!
attention!
this is your new class mascot.
what happened to your dog?
this is not a dog.
this is a ferret.
what's a ferret?
that's a ferret.
oh!
if he bites you,
you get rabies and die.
no. that's not true.
he never bites.
can i pet him?
sure, but one at a time, okay?
good. okay, next one.
come on.
yes.
good.
yeah.
good. now we're having fun.
what's that
supposed to mean?
mrs. hagley
is a lot better than you.
is she?
is she really?
my mom's a teacher
in this school...
and she's a lot better
than you, too.
great.
on monday nights,
my mom tutors
and mrs. quinn
takes care of me.
she's better than you, too.
great.
and frankie,
my swimming teacher..
and gus, my tball coach,
are better than you, too.
i really appreciate
your honesty.
you happen to know someone
that's not better than me?
i don't know
that many people.
john?
are you there?
how did it go?
go away.
it went that well, huh?
you take over tomorrow.
and blow our cover?
can't do it.
they're horrible.
tell me about it.
he's gay.
what kind of a man
teaches kindergarten?
he's obviously gay.
a male kindergarten teacher
isn't what i'm used to.
samantha calls him
the giant.
there he is.
where, honey?
holy cow, is that
your new teacher?
yeah.
oh, my god.
what are you doing?
 i'm not wearing makeup.
 none of us are.
you're married.
you're allowed to look like slobs.
be good. i'll be back
to pick you up.
good morning,
mr kimble.
good morning.
i told you he was big.
play with the kids, honey.
hi. i'm jillian,
sylvester's mom.
do you have a minute?
i'd like to speak with you.
sure.
please.
thank you.
a male kindergarten teacher
that's unusual.
you're not from
around here, are you?
no. i'm not.
neither am i.
huh.
anyway...
um...
i have a small problem.
yes?
you see, sylvester's father
doesn't live with us anymore...
and i've just been
worried about sylvester
he's been acting
a little strange lately...
you know, doing odd things.
like what?
well, it seems
that's he's becoming
a little obsessed
with playing with dolls.
you know, it's weird.
i think i can help you
with that.
really?
he uses the dolls
to look up girls' skirts.
i caught him
doing it yesterday.
oh. oh, well,
that's a relief.
but i'll keep
an eye on him, okay?
thank you.
does sylvester
ever see his father?
no. no, not since he was 2.
his father lives in california.
that is far away.
mmhmm.
well, if you give me
his name and number..
i could talk to him
about taking
more interest in his son.
that's very kind,
but i don't think so.
but it's tough on sylvester,
don't you think?
no.
no, what's tough on sylvester
is his father left us
for another man.
are you married,
mr kimble?
no, i'm not.
he's not married, mom!
welcome to astoria...
the single-parent capital
of america.
thank you for your time.
i pledge allegiance
to the flag
of the united states
of america...
and to the republic
for which it stands...
one nation, under god...
indivisible...
with liberty
and justice for all.
are these all your lunches?
you mean you eat other
people's lunches?
stop it!
now we're going to do
something extremely fun.

driven by women who are pinheads.
my dad doesn't do
anything since the crash.
my dad gives money to people

then people use that money...
then they give
other money back
and they give the same amount
of money back to my dad.
my dad doesn't live
with us anymore.
he lives in new york
and drives a taxi.
my mom hopes he's going to die
real soon.
my dad watches tv
all day long.
my dad works on computers
and he's, um, the boss
of his company
and, um, he has a mustache
and a beard.

he doesn't have that
much hair because he is old
and his head is so big
that he can't wear any hats.
my dad's divorced.
my mom's divorced.
my dad, um,
is a psychologist...
and he helps people
that are hurt
or lost their feelings...
and, um, that's it.
our mom says that our dad
is a real sex machine.
good.
i don't know
what my dad does.
i haven't seen him
in a long time.
he lives in france.
my dad is a gynecologist...
and he looks at vaginas
all day long.
mi pap trabaja
en la casa...
y el juega conmigo mucho.

very good.
okay. next, uh...
what's his name
with his back to me?
his name's zach sullivan.
he doesn't like anyone
to talk to him.
he's a poopoo head.
he's a poopoo face.
he's a caca poopoo.
he's a poopoo caca.
 poopoo caca!
 poopoo caca!
 poopoo caca!
 poopoo caca!
quiet.
that's enough.
hey, zach.

teach you this game?

come on. quiet.
quiet! come on.
shh! quiet.
well, we're all glad
the kindergarten class
could join us.
that's four minutes.
you should be ashamed
of yourselves.
all the other grades...
your times were an improvement...
but they're still
not good enough.
but they're still
not good enough.
i'm very disappointed.
all right, let's get
back into school.
mrs. sullivan!
mrs. sullivan!
so the doctor says
it's a stomach flu.
i'm fine. i can
eat anything i want.
let's find a restaurant.
can we talk business?
there are 14 boys
in the classroom.
so far i have three possible suspects,
one likely.
here's a picture.
you listening?
i'm listening.
his name's zach sullivan.
what do you think?
he's cute.
doesn't anybody eat around here?
listen, he's a dead ringer
for crisp. look.
maybe. come on, john.
i'm hungry.
a table for two.
thank you very much.
two hot dogs.
two hot dogs?
mr kimble!
mr kimble!
dominic.
it's him, mom.
joyce.
hello, joyce.
dominic has been a great help.
he's a good kid.
who's that?
who?
her
oh, that?
uh, that is, uh...
i am his sister
oh, really?
i wouldn't have guessed.
you have to excuse my brother
he has no manners.
my name is ursula.
wonderful to meet you.
i'm visiting here
from austria.
i'm joyce paulmarie.
i work at john's school.
ah.
and this is dominic.
nice to meet you.
would you like
to join us for dinner?
 no.
 ja.
ja.
yes, of course.
that would be great.
hi. there will
be four of us.
table 27.
why did you tell her
you were my sister?
relax, butch.
the love doctor is here.
come to me.
i want to start.
okay. i want
a rib eye steak
with mashed potatoes
and a large green salad.
oh, no.
wait a minute.
i want to start
with the spicy
chicken wings.
are they the tiny ones
without meat?
actually, it's quite
a large serving.
ah, good.
ooh, good arms.
and a large bowl
of the clam chowder
uh, and the blueberry pie
with ice cream for dessert.
ja.
i like how they talk.
i've been trying to get to
know the parents...
but some of them
are avoiding me.
some of them
are like that.
it's a strange town that way...
especially with new arrivals.
what do you mean?
i think a lot of people
that come to small towns
are trying to get
away from something
or they're
hiding something.
like what?
well, for example,
what brought you here?
me? well,
there was an opening
for a kindergarten teacher
yeah, but what made you
become a kindergarten teacher?
i mean, it is a bit unusual.
john is a bit unusual.
well...
you are.
i was born in austria.
my father was a teacher
my mother was a teacher
so is ursula.
ja.
we have a tradition in austria
where we follow
the footsteps of our parents.
so when i moved
to this country...
i taught geography
and physical education
in arizona...
and then i coached basketball
at an allgirls school
in rhode island, but...
none of it made me
really happy.
why weren't you happy?
ja. why weren't you happy?
well, i got tired of
teaching teenagers...
because by the time
they came to me...
i felt there wasn't
much i could do with them.
i realized that the real action
is in kindergarten.
how long have you been
teaching kindergarten?
it's my second day.
oh.
ooh, excuse me,
but it's good.
it is good.
thanks again.
nice to meet you.
thank you.
bye.
i had a great time.
yeah, me, too.
well, kimble,
i think you scored.
whoa, whoa, whoa.
what are you talking about?
i'm only interested in her
because she works
at the school.
she knows the children
and the parents.
if you were any stiffer..
we could take you surfing.
now, i know you
like that woman.
what is your problem?
the only problem i've got
is that i'm doing your job.
you should be
cleaning up the paint
and reading stories
about bears that go shopping.
i'm stuck with your job.
yeah. you are.
that's right. i am.
look, you're going
to be out of here
in a few days.
you told me yourself
you had a few good leads.
you'll be back dealing
with junkies and murderers
in no time.
they're pushing me around.
who?
the kids.
they're walking all over me.
listen, kimble.
you got to handle this
like any other police situation.
you walk into it showing fear..
you're dead...
and those kids know you're scared.
no fear
no fear
today we're going to play
a new fun game.
it's called police school.
i'm going to be your sheriff.
you're going to be
my deputy trainees.
come on.
stop whining.
you kids are soft.
you lack discipline.
well, i've got news for you.
you are mine now.
you belong to me!
you're not going to have
your mommies here
to wipe your tushies.
oh, no.
it's time to turn
this mush into muscles.
no more complaining.
no more, i have to go
to the bathroom.
there is no bathroom!
now, the first thing the
deputy trainees have to learn
is to freeze
whenever you hear this.
now, the next time you hear
this whistle...
each one of you get
one toy.
how many?

good. then bring it back
to the carpet...

take your milk.
it makes you big and strong.
it's story time, mr kimble.
all right.
we all like this one...
and if you read us a story now...
everybody will go to sleep.
all right.
i used to read this to my son.
what's his name?
who?
your son.
oh, alex is his name.
where is he?
he lives with his mother
you see, his mother and i...
we are...
divorced. i know.
what's a divorce?
it's when your daddy
lives someplace else
and comes over
to take you places...
and your mommy says
he's a deadbeat.
no. it's when the daddy
doesn't want to see
his little boy anymore.
that's not what it is.
why don't you want to see
your little boy?
was he bad?
no, he was not bad.
it wasn't his fault at all.
you see...
his mommy and i,
we just nev...
just sit down, okay?
let me just start reading.
why don't you all lie down?
okay.
good. and rest.
if you were a bird
and lived on high
you'd lean on the wind
when the wind came by.
you'd say to the wind
when it took you away...
that's where
i wanted to go today.
where am i going?
i don't quite know.
what does it matter
where people go?
down to the wood
where the bluebells grow.
anywhere.
anywhere.
i don't know.
huh!
hi.
hi.
i didn't mean
to startle you.
i must have dozed off.
i can't believe you
got them all to sleep.
i worked them hard.
i was wondering if...
you'd like to come
to my place for dinner
tomorrow night.
i would like that.
yes.
great.
well, here are
the directions.
how about 6:30, 7:00?
that would be fine.
what?
um...
you... you've got
a little mustache.
oh, it must be
from the milk.
well, i'd better
get back to class.
i'll see you tomorrow.
see you tomorrow.
freeze!
no!
no.
this is henry shoop...
my fianc.
hi.
your fianc?
yeah, my fianc.
henry, this is
obviously my partner..
john kimble.
oh, jeez.
uh...
hi.
how you doing?
let me get this...
and i'll be right out.
oh!
it's okay, honey.
i'll be right out.
it's my birthday.
well, congratulations.
thanks. he came up here
just to surprise me.
and he made me my favorite...
pasta a olio.
i love you, henry.
i love you, too, phoebes.
uh... well, i've got
to head back tonight.
i've got to work.
henry's a chef.
i'm a chef.
you're marrying a chef?
i'm marrying
a great chef.
that figures.
you mean that,
a great chef?
of course.
you're a genius, henry.
not just a good chef?
well, nice to meet you.
congratulations.
happy birthday.
thanks.
you want some of this?
it wasn't overcooked?
you're the best.
it wasn't a little overcooked?
no. al dente.
zach.
excuse me. i'm john kimble,
zach's teacher
i didn't know
he was following me.
hi. i've been leaving messages
on your machine.
i'm sorry.
things have been hectic.
what about now?
uh...
go for a little walk.
your teacher and i
have to talk.
uh...
i know what this is about.
i suppose you saw
the bruises on zach's legs?
my husband has started
counseling about this.
he's been going
for three weeks now.
please don't bring
the school system into it.
it will make matters worse.
he's beating you, too?
if he wasn't going
to counseling...
i could see the point
of saying something...
but i'm sure there won't be
any more occurrences.
you won't say anything,
will you?
please?
if he does it again,
i press charges.
zach.
you got the stuff?
thanks, man.
here, lady.
i gave her your stuff.
where's the rest of my money?
who are you, old lady?
your fairy godmother
come in.
hi. it took all day
but i found out zach sullivan
and his mother aren't related to that guy crisp.
i just found out.
oh. i got a bottle of wine
for your big date...
it's not a date, i know.
but joyce shouldn't think that.
thanks. i don't think
it's a good idea.
quickest way to slip up
doing undercover work
is doing things
you normally wouldn't do.
wait a minute.
you mean you wouldn't take wine
to a woman
who's invited you for dinner?
of course you would.
and flowers as well.
here you go.
she'll love them.
well, here we are.
wow. this is
quite a place.
they must be paying you
a lot more than
they're paying me.
i wish it was my house.
it belongs to a friend of mine.
after the divorce,
he said we could stay here
in exchange
for keeping the place up.
you must have nice friends.
yes, i do.
dinner won't be ready
for a few minutes.
can you start a fire?
it shouldn't be a problem.
i'll show you
where the wood is.
come on. come on!
right here.
in here.
this is my secret hiding spot.
wow.
this is amazing.
i made it myself.
what's this?
don't touch that!
it's a laser..
and it'll burn a hole
right through you.
okay. i'll be careful.
oh, don't shoot.
 boom! boom!
 don't shoot.
i put up these lasers
to protect us.
to protect you from what?
the bad people.
do you want to see
something else?
come on.
what?
see that?
you mean the tower?
i'm going to plant one
of my lasers on that antenna.
but i'll have to do it at night.
otherwise the bad people
will know where it is.
last one to the table
is a rotten banana!
have you guys had fun?
yeah. be right out!
what you doing in there?
i'm lost.
where is the dining room?
this house is huge.
 follow me, silly.
 whew.
these are beautiful pictures
of you and dominic.
thank you.
when i was putting
dominic to bed...
he mentioned you had a son, too.
that's right.
but i'm divorced.
i'm lucky. my ex got remarried
to a very nice man.
he's really good to my son.
i see him a lot.
what about your ex-husband?
does he see dominic a lot?
uh, no. after the divorce,
he moved back to france.
what about child support
and alimony?
does he take care of you?
i'm sorry about
being so personal.
i was so glad to see him go
i didn't worry
about that part.
dominic doesn't even remember him.
i prefer it that way.
are you sure?
yeah.
why?
well, dominic was talking to me
about having to move around a lot
to keep the bad people away.
bad people?
something about having to leave
in the middle of the night
and leave his toys behind.
oh, god.
i thought he'd
forgotten about that.
i'm sorry.
i didn't mean to upset you.
it's not your fault.
the truth is, my ex-husband
is a walking nightmare.
he didn't leave us, we left him.
he found out where we were
and tried to kidnap dominic.
he doesn't know where we are now...
and i'd like to keep it that way.
of course.
i'm glad he's in france
and doesn't live nearby.
he doesn't live in france.
i told dominic
that he lived in france.
i didn't know who my ex-husband was
when i married him.
i was young and stupid,
and i made a mistake.
i don't want dominic
to pay for it.
look, nobody around here
knows anything about this.
i can't even believe
i told you.
you have to promise me
you won't tell anyone.
you can trust me.
that's very good. perfect.
okay. let's try it again.
mary, you first.
fourscores and seven years ago.
fourscores and seven years ago.
our forefathers brought...
four fathers?
mr kimble, did lincoln
have four fathers?
uh...
i had three fathers...
one named walt,
two named ralph.
did lincoln have
four mothers?
as a matter of fact,
he had two mothers.
unfortunately,
the first one died.
i knew it.
um... okay.
let's take a break.
come on.
i want you to walk around
in a circle. go.
start. come on.
well, joyce's story
about the house checked out.
it belongs to a guy
who only uses it
during the ski season.
she's got under $1,000
in the bank...
no stocks, no bonds, no other assets
under the name joyce paulmarie.
her teacher's salary is less than mine,
which is pathetic.
keep looking. check for offshore
accounts under dominic's name...
she doesn't live like someone
with millions of dollars.
she doesn't even
seem the type.
kimble, this might not be her
it's got to be her
why? because she
doesn't want to have
anything to do
with her ex-husband?
i know it's her
know what i think?
you want it to be her
you really like her,
and it's scaring you.
excuse me!
surprise!
ladies!
ladies, surprise.
obviously, i'm not
into baking cakes...
so i brought
these little things
to donate
for the raffle prizes.
who the hell is that?
she's the one
i was telling you about.
her husband ran away
with another guy.
it's been terrible for her
you're not getting
mellow on me, are you?
hi.
come on. 1, 2, 3, 4.
come on. go, go.
i see they stuck you
with the gettysburg address this year
they sure did.
company, halt!
um...
about last night...
i've been thinking
about it, and i'm glad i told you
all those things.
so am i.
um... ii better
get going.
yeah. i have
to get going, too.
is everything okay?
yeah.
see you tomorrow at the fair
i'm looking forward to it.
what are you looking at?
ha ha ha!
shh!
march! 1, 2, 3, 4.
i was just talking
to the teacher, that's all.
yeah. don't laugh.
okay. i'm proud of you.
keep going.
i'm sorry zach's late.
the car wouldn't start.
you be a good boy.
i love you.
hi, champ.
oh!
what's the matter?
oh, no.
i fell down again.
hey, wait a minute.
uh...
i forgot to close the door
to the basement...
and zach had a bad fall.
you all say the same thing,
he fell down.
don't you have
anything better to say?
i don't have to
justify myself to you!
you have no right
talking to me like that.
how are you doing?
you must be the mr kimble
we hear so much about.
you must be the mr kimble
we hear so much about.
you hit the kid, i hit you.
you bastard!
you're not worth it.
i'm pressing charges against you.
excuse me, everybody.
i'm sorry.
i shouldn't have hit the man...
especially in front of the children.
it was a mistake.
i checked you out.
there is no record of you
ever having taught
at any public school...
in california
or anywhere else.
mr kimble...
you have no teaching experience
whatsoever, do you?
someone finally noticed.
i thought
the introduction of a ferret
was a horrible idea...
but the children
seemed to like it.
i thought the use of your police whistle
was outrageous...
that's all i could think of.
please allow me to finish.
 sorry.
 but it worked.
i have no idea what kind
of police officer you are...
but you're a very good teacher
thank you.
now, will you tell me something?
don't lie.
what did it feel like
to hit that son of a bitch?
it felt great.
yeah.
well, tomorrow morning.
bright and early.
thank you.
yeah.
yeah, that's her
and there goes
our goddamn case.
tell o'hara and kimble
their witness is dead...
so crisp is going to walk.
we want them back here.
we've got lots
of other cases to clear
o'hara says they think
they've located the wife.
and the money?
they're looking into it.
have them tell the wife
we're letting crisp go,
and he knows where she is.
if she wants police protection,
she'll produce the money.
sorry it took so long, cullen.
hey, you're looking great.
i love you, mother
we're going to be
a family again, son.
go!
fourscore and seven years ago
fourscore and seven years ago
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent
a new nation
a new nation
conceived in liberty
conceived in liberty
and dedicated
to the proposition
and dedicated
to the proposition
that all men
are created equal
that all men
are created equal
and that government
and that government
of the people
by the people
and for the people
shall not perish
from this earth.
thank you very much.
oh!
i'd like to introduce you
to our kindergarten teacher
he came to us
as a substitute teacher..
and he's proven to be
a wonderful asset.
let's welcome him
into our community
and hope that he considers
staying on a permanent basis.
ladies and gentlemen...
mr john kimble.
nice town.
hmm.
ahh! smell that fresh air
we should think about
buying something up here...
like some log cabin
in the woods near a lake.
kids love
that outdoor kind of stuff.
i'll be in the pharmacy.
try not to step in anything.
i'd like to help you.
but we're pretty much
out of the race cars...
unless...
this is the last one.
it's still in great shape.
if you don't mind waiting,
i'll wrap it up.
i'll knock 10% off...
i have a better idea.
i'll pay you twice
what he's charging.
i promised my boy
i'd get him one.
i'd love to help you...
but my kid's been bugging me
since christmas.
i'll pay you four times
what it's worth.
get your kid
something even better
sorry.
can you giftwrap it?
hanna, could you
wrap that, please?
no harm in trying.
tourists.
great, dominic.
you're doing well.
i'll wait over here for you, okay?
okay.
great day, huh?
we've run out of time.
we've got to press joyce now.
what do you mean?
 cindy o.d.'d last night.
 shit.
they released crisp this morning.
he's probably on his way here.
salazar said if joyce
is crisp's wife...
she's got to cooperate
about the money...
or she gets no police protection.
bastard.
ursula, how are you?
what?
i've got to tell you the truth.
her name's not ursula.
she's not my sister
i beg your pardon?
we're not who you think we are.
what is this?
we're police officers.
we know who you are...
rachel.
this is a joke, right?
no. this is no joke.
you took $3 million.
i think...
crisp knows where you are.
he could be here any minute.
where's dominic?
you'll get immunity
for your testimony...
but we need you to help us.
where's dominic?
on a pony.
we'll offer protection
if you tell us about the money.
there's no money,
you son of a bitch.
there never was!
no, it's not fair!
i'm not finished yet!
the bad people
have found us.
what do you mean, no money?
why are you mad at mr kimble?
because he's a jerk.
leave me alone!
joyce, wait!
wait!
if you didn't take the money...
why is he after you?
he doesn't want me.
he wants dominic.
she's going to run again.
yeah.
unless we do something about it.
yeah.
hey, snap out of it!
daryl. daryl.
i'm sorry. i wanted to give you
a second chance.
what is wrong with you?
i'm still not getting
through to you, am i, daryl?
mother, got this great surprise
for junior
that'll be 57.90.
children's aspirin,
children's decongestant...
antihistamine.
a thermometer?
a lot of flu
going around, right?
it is the season.
the boy's not sick.
doesn't hurt to take precautions.
mother, you are going
to make him sick.
you stuffed all this crap into me,
and nothing was wrong.
that's why there was
nothing wrong with you.
now, how can you
argue with that?
joyce!
joyce! dominic!
you bastard!
where's dominic?
i don't know.
what happened?
you led him here.
if he has dominic, i'll kill you.
let go of me!
we'll find him. stop it.
we'll find him.
we'll find him.
dominic!
did he say anything
before he left?
he said something
about getting his lasers.
lasers? i think
i know where he is.
aah! help!
help! help!
somebody!
help!
hold on!
i'll get him down.
help!
hold on. i'm right here.
good boy.
all right. just hold on.
okay. just hold on.
oh, good. okay.
i was going to put the lasers
in the antenna.
i know. don't worry
about anything now.
i got you.
just hold on tight now.
hold on tight, okay?
good.
if i lost dominic...
i don't think
i could go on living.
you're not going to lose him.
that's right. i'm not.
cullen said i stole his money
so these creeps would
follow us for a reward.
you don't know what he's like.
oh, yes, i do.
i know him well.
that's why i don't
want him to get you two.
can't trust you or anybody.
you can trust me.
that's what you said before.
and you turned out to be a cop.
l...
i didn't mean
to hurt you.
i wish i was
a kindergarten teacher..
but i'm not.
i'm a cop.
that's all i know how to be.
i have to get out of here.
you have a son.
if you were me,
you'd do the same thing.
i have a son i've hardly seen
in seven years.
i don't mean anything to him.
my ex-wife got remarried.
she doesn't want me
to be part of his life.
i lost my family.
i should never
have let it happen.
why are you telling me
all of this?
i don't want to lose you.
i don't want to lose dominic.
i swear you'll never have
to run from him again.
don't worry about anything, okay?
we're going to be
right across the hall.
everything's going to be fine.
we just want
to be extra careful.
thanks.
don't worry.
whoo!
all right, all right.
settle down.
good morning.
good morning, mr kimble.
sit down.
it's very nice
to see you all again.
meet my very good friend,
phoebe o'hara.
good morning, phoebe.
miss o'hara
is going to talk to you
about something very important.
so pay attention to what
she has to say, okay?
remember, no fear
thanks.
yeah?
boys have a penis.
girls have a vagina.
well, you taught them the basics.
that's important.
okay, now...
today we're going to talk
about something else
that's really important.
today we're going
to talk about strangers.
if a stranger knocks
on your door..
never answer the door
because we never talk
to strangers.
let's say that together
we never talk to strangers.
right.
can we talk to kids?
yeah, it's okay.
you can talk to kids.
what about dogs?
huh?
can we talk to dogs?
yeah, you can talk to dogs.
but what you can't do...
what you must
never ever do is...
never talk to strangers.
on the kindergarten level...
we try to emphasize the three c's:
caring, courtesy and courage.
courage.
that's my philosophy, too.
are you a single parent,
mr green?
no, my wife had to stay behind
to complete the sale of our home.
i'm checking the schools
before we buy a home here.
most kindergarten children
can't read yet.
my son can.
he reads at 6?
that's good.
and writes.
i taught him myself.
he sounds like
a special child.
he is. he's a great athlete.
here's what you've waited for
the kindergarten.
have a look.
oh, dominic, dominic...
dominic is king
of the mountain!
way to go, dominic.
here's your crown.
congratulations, dominic.
the king of mount kimble!
dominic.
he looks odd, but he's
a wonderful teacher
yes, i'm sure he is.
did you see cullen jr?
yeah, yeah.
she calls him dominic.
she'd always wanted
to name him dominic.
what a dumb name.
put that cigar out.
it's unhealthy for the kid.
then you make your aeroplane
go up into the clouds.
check it out.
right.
okay, stay calm.
okay, it's probably
a fire drill.
oh, man.
kimble, the hallway's
full of smoke.
okay, this is a fire drill.
come on.
this is the real thing.
just the way we practiced.
go out there.
fast. just the way
we practiced it.
come on.
come on.
it's only water
don't be scared.
stay close to the wall.
let's go.
come on. come on.
dominic, stay close to me, okay?
stay close to me.
stay behind me.
don't get separated.
aah!

he's inside.
kimble's looking for him.
joyce!
joyce!
help!
it's okay. it's okay.
i'm not going to hurt you.
i'm not going to hurt you.
it's okay.
i'm a fireman.
i help people.
well, where's your hat?
my hat?
i love this.
i can't fool my own boy.
he's just 6 years old.
you're right.
i'm no jerk fireman.
i'm going to tell you
something, dominic.
it's going to be hard
for you to understand...
but you got to believe me.
i'm your father, dominic.
your father
don't you recognize me?
no.
sure you do.
it's me.
don't you remember
twinkle, twinkle, little star?
we have the same kind of hands.
don't you remember?
you're not my father
my father lives in france.
your mother told you that...
but that's not true!
i'm your father!
i've been searching
for you for five years.
help! help!
dominic, i'm your father
you're going to have
to do what i say.
do you understand?
freeze!
don't you know
there's a fire?
we thought it was another drill.
well, get out!
yes, sir
whoa, honey.
that's a fire in there.
i got a kid in there.
i'm a cop.
if i need a ticket fixed,
i'll call you.
in the meantime, stay out.
go on.
all right.
quiet, you hear me? quiet.
no!
rachel!
let go!
just what i need.
please, let him go.
let him go!
how the hell
do you get out of here?
please, please,
don't do this!
you're scaring him!
scared? of course he's scared.
you told him lies about me.
my son doesn't know me
because of you.
listen!
just listen.
you stole him from me!
please, give him back.
don't touch him!
aah!
dominic, i had to do it!
i didn't want to do it.
she made me.
everything's going
to be okay, dominic.
dominic?
come back.
we're getting out of here.
dominic?
going to start
a whole new family.
aah!
dominic!
gotcha!
i love you.
do you understand?
tell me you understand that.
say it. say it!
i understand.
daddy.
daddy.
hold it!
right there.

don't. don't.
he's not your hostage.
he's your son.

drop it!
i'm losing it! hurry!
relax. i'm putting it down.
hurry!
here it is.
here it is.
just don't harm the boy, okay?
good. good. that's smart.
all right.
why don't you let the boy go now?
the boy is mine!
he's my boy!

aah!
no!

i'm okay. get dominic.

you son of a bitch!
you're not so tough
without your car..
are you?
mr kimble,
are you all right?
oh, i hate this.
nah, he doesn't
want to eat that.
he's a tough guy.
tough guys don't eat jello.
i'll come back later
hi.
hi. how are you feeling?
much better
how about you?
i'll live.
check out of here.
this stuff will kill you.

i'm not going
to throw up on you...
but i am going to kiss you.
phoebe.

how's everybody feeling today?
i brought goodies.
did i do that?

i've got some goodies here.
i got it caught.
and something
i cooked myself.
i almost didn't recognize you
with all your clothes on.
you look good yourself.
aah!

the wedding.
yeah. uh...
you're coming
to the wedding, right?

hmm?
they're all yours.
hi, kids.
mr kimble!
i'm back.

this is one hell of a way
to spend christmas.
 mulcahey!
 sir
secure the sidewalk.
no one gets in or out.
i have a present for you!
pigs!
let the children go!
damn you, ripper!
slater!!
do no even think it, slater
wait for the hostage negotiator
goddamn it, jack,
i am talking to you!
the last time you pulled this
jive, jitterbug, tough gonad shit 
 people lost bodyparts!
if you go in there,
you will lose your badge!
jack, as mayor of this city, 
 you and i have had our tiffs,
but this is the lieutenant governor
 when the governor gets here, call me.
 do not let slater in.
repeat: do not let him in!
piece of cake.
do you want to be a farmer?
here is a couple of acres.
 dekker, the next one i will hurt.
 slater, do not go in there!
check fire. there is a plainclothes
officer in the building.
 jack, what kept you?
 dad!
andy is getting nervous.
i promised him you would come.
i gave him my word he could
watch you die. lose the cannon.
has he hurt you, andrew?
did you say hurt, jack?
what do you know about hurt?
 you put me in a cage for ten years.
 you deserved the death penalty.
yes, whatever
things crawl around in my head
and sit on my chest when i wake up.
do you know what it is like?
your illegal search rendered
the bloody axe inadmissable. remember?
now lose the gun.
all right, i am unarmed.
let the boy go.
just one gun, jack?
you must be kidding.
 is that all, sport?
 yes, that about does it.
then step away.
chopchop.
unless you consider this a weapon.
brilliant, jack. brilliant.
i surrender
 that is a live grenade.
 sure.
you will sacrifice your son to get me.
i am flattered, but i doubt it.
andy, pick up the grenade.
go on.
show it to me.
jack, that toy cannot
hurt the boy.
but this one can.
focus!
come on, focus!
people are trying to sleep.
the film is out of focus.
the film... never mind.
nick!
nick, are you okay?
the climax is on the fritz.
i never used to do that, danny.
it is okay. i have seen this slater
six times. i was just worried.
the new jack slater opens
this weekend.
like i did not know that.
they killed his cousin. big mistake!
jack slater iv.
i am checking the print tonight.
midnight. just myself.
i could get you admittance,
if that sort of thing appeals to you.
see it before it opens?
who do i have to kill?
just get to school.
you will only be four hours late.
treachery, conspiracy, sex,
sword fights, madness, ghosts.
and everybody dies.
shakespeare's hamlet
could not be more exciting.
and though he may seem
incapable of taking action, 
 he is one of the first
action heroes.
you will now see a scene from
the film by laurence olivier
you may have seen him in the
polaroid commercial 
 or as zeus in
clash of the titans.
o bosom black as death.
help angels.
all may yet be well.
now he is praying.
and now i will do it.
 and so he goes to heaven.
 do not talk, just do it.
hey, claudius.
you killed my father
big mistake.
something is rotten
in the state of denmark.
and hamlet
is taking out the trash.
 stay thy hand, fair prince.
 who said i am fair?
no one is going to tell
this sweet prince goodnight.
to be... or not to be.
not to be.
the whole morning?
he was not?
no, he was not at school today.
he is sick as a lamb.
tell me the story of your life
starting this morning, first period.
and make it good.
something along the lines of:
i cut so i could donate a kidney.
were you at the movies again?
that crazy guy is an accessory.
 nick is not crazy.
 damn it, danny!
i lied to a principal. and what for?
so you can go to the movies?
sorry.
i did not choose this.
i did not ask to become a widow
before the age of forty.
i know that.
give me a hug.
 i will not cut again.
 let me hear the p word.
i promise.
jesus! i am late.
i have to get to work.
lock the top lock
the minute i close the door
and do not open for anyone.
bye. i love you.
are you alone?
okay. move it!
do yourself to the drain.
tough guy.
do it.
i will make it easier for you.
go ahead.
do it.
what is it with you?
you have junk!
no jewelry, no vcr
a shit tv worth twenty bucks.
go fish, amigo.
remember your mom says
you are to go straight home.
she will be there
when the shift is over
if we find the guy,
i will give you a call.
 i almost gave up on you.
 i am sorry.
 what do you think?
 i have never seen anything like it.
 it is not too tight, is it?
 no. it is the style.
i always wanted to be a magician.
but my hands were too tiny.
my father worked here
and got me my first job. usher
i worked myself up to projectionist.
it is not much, but it is showbiz.
so, is the print ready?
just a minute, young man.
are we not forgetting something?
you have to have a ticket to see
a movie. and i have just the one.
when i was your age, harry houdini
played here and i met him backstage.
and he made a gesture
like this.
and all of a sudden
this was in his hand.
and he said to me:
this is a magic ticket.
i got it from an indian magician,
who got it from a tibetan magician.
it is a passport to another world.
it was mine.
and now it is yours.
and now it is yours.
 what does it do, nick?
 i never had the courage to find out.
i have always wanted to try,
but i was afraid it would not work.
at your age houdini was like a god
to me. what if he was faking?
and then again...
 what if it did work?
 what if it did?
houdini said something else.
he said:
this ticket has a mind of its own.
it does what it wants to do.
that always made me edgy.
i guess there is only one way
to find out then. right?
please retain your stub, sir
 shall we see if slater wins?
 jack slater cannot lose.
never has, never will.
oh, frankie.
frankie, why do you
keep on with the insults?
 i would not insult you, mr vivaldi.
 when you lie, that is an insult.
you are jack slater's favourite cousin.
you talk all the time.
i must know what slater knows
and you are going to tell me.
does he know
that me and torelli 
 have just signed
a secret pact to control 
 all drugs
in southern california?
we mostly talk
muzzle velocities. guns.
meet mr benedict.
the genuine article.
and you better believe it.
sometimes he likes to bake
while he shoots people.
i am saying that mr benedict
can take you out as easy as cake.
pie, you sicilian schmuck.
the man is a surgeon.
do you want me to make him
operate on you?
i swear i do not know.
dump him at his place.
but take it easy.
he bought it. he actually believes
me and torelli are banding together
the beauty part is, nobody knows
different. until after the funeral.
then everybody knows.
everybody knows
tony vivaldi is number one.
you are going to pay.
is this right?
it does not look like a crack house.
do you want 60 guys dancing on
the lawn throwing cocaine at each other?
 what's up, guys?
 quiet. this is a drug bust.
drug bust? you must be joking.
my cousin frank lives here.
the only drugs he has is aspirin.
if you touch that front door,
you are going to need them.
it must be a mistake.
we received an anonymous tip.
frank?
jack, listen to me.
 who did this?
 listen to me.
this is important.
tony vivaldi and the torelli mob
are joining forces.
i am out of here.
sorry, frank.
it is a bomb!
he is okay. minor wound.
both cops dead.
two days to retirement.
nick?
 who the hell are you?
 do not shoot me! i am a kid.
 how did you get here?
 i do not think you want to know.
close your eyes, stay flat
and do not move!
you are driving with no hands!
you have to practice
and never do it in heavy traffic.
i iced that guy,
to cone a phrase.
wait... the bad puns,
the voice, the hard rock.
this is really happening.
this is not happening.
repeat: this is not...
i threw up. sorry.
i thought i was going to die.
i am sorry to disappoint you, but you
will live to enjoy the fruits of life.
acne, shaving, premature
ejaculation and divorce.
does this suck weenie or what?
this is a movie set.
this is a movie. that is how
the scenery changed, right?
you are going to play chicken, right?
just like jack slater
fasten your seat belt, please.
your fingers?
cross as many as you can.
i am in the movie.
holy cow, i am in the movie.
nick, houdini was not faking.
jack, did you see that?
i was just in a real police station.
and this is much nicer
slater, it is your ex-wife
on line two!
you stay.
she is always calling me.
hello, sweetheart.
it is nice to hear your voice.
 oiler! you team up with waterman.
 give me a partner, sarge.
that is right.
of course.
no, just as you said.
krause!
you team up with the rabbi.
 how do you get to carnegie hall?
 practice!
john practice, you s.o.b.
why are you not in washington?
the bureau thinks there is
something going on between...
vivaldi is joining forces
with torelli.
 how do you do that?
 i do not sit around eating donuts.
those are government donuts.
i have to call d.c.
good for you.
watch it, jack.
he killed mozart.
 in a movie?
 amadeus. it won 8 oscars!
i saved him in 'nam,
so i will be on the lookout.
now, no more movies.
slater!!
the city council is chewing my eggs
off for your plane crash!
the mayor is parading up my
lincoln tunnel for that beach stunt!
everybody wants to know
what it will be!
 do i make myself clear?!
 i am just doing my job.
you have given us the worst
reputation in the country!
the chamber of commerce is doing
cartwheels in my cocoa factory!
ratcliff, you are on duty
with the cat.
hiya, toots!
 join me for a flea bath later?
 touch me again and i will kill you!
 i can prove this is a movie.
 who are you?
it is a cartoon cat.
he is supposed to be back.
he was only suspended a month.
listen to me. an animated cat
just walked into the squad room.
 he will do it again tomorrow.
 that cat is one of my best men.
who is that smiling twerp?
i love the way you fight, knowing
how you really feel about each other
how do i feel about this
sack of puppy poo?
you are dearest friends.
after your wife left you 
 jack told everyone he drove
her to the diphtheria clinic.
when he came back, you said:
you saved me from humiliation.
you are my dearest friend.
 you promised not to tell.
 i did not.
 then how did he know?
 jack slater i.
 won what?
 no, the first jack slater
you told your dad?
i told no one.
i do not know this kid.
he seems to know
a lot about us.
the state of new york has
never heard of you, mr madigan.
 what is your name?
 danny madigan.
 where are you from?
 how did you get in my car?
i fell off a bridge into your car
he saved my life.
truth at last.
now why were they after you?
my cousin frank found out
some drug information.
do not believe
what vivaldi told him.
 how do you know about vivaldi?
 i know what is going on.
 if you would just listen...
 i have the perfect listener for you.
meet your new partner
oh no... better to die.
you will love it, jack.
we are perfect buddy material.
i teach you to be vulnerable,
you teach me to be brave.
i am jack slater's new partner
we work together in this film.
you know i am right.
if this was the real world, 
 they would not make us partners,
but send me to a social worker
how do i know they tortured frank
and stashed him behind his door?
i saw it on screen.
this is a movie.
you are very clever, and i would
be roaring with laughter, 
 but they killed my cousin.
and that is a...
big mistake. that is what
you were going to say, right?
 how would i know that?
 no one likes a smartass.
then shoot me. point your gun
at my head and pull the trigger
come on. do it.
i double dare you.
but you are not going to do it.
you do not kill kids in the movies.
because you are the good guy.
you really believe you are
inside a movie, do you not?
you have ten minutes to prove it.
and then i shoot you.
 schwarzenegger films?
 foreign films are in the back.
 no, this guy is an action star
 down the centre on the left.
no, it is not possible.
what? he is fantastic.
it is his best performance ever
 it was you in that movie.
 you were in a movie?
yes, called girl of my dreams.
it starred you.
we had a very romantic
scene together
 what is the store's phone number?
 5552310.
what is your home number?
you can give it to him.
i am a police officer
 5553812.
 amazing.
i will bet that everyone
has a 555 number
there can only be 9999 numbers
that start with 555.
 how many people live in l.a.?
 eight or nine million.
that is why we have area codes.
 is this your kid?
 oh no.
he is a mental patient
that i am taking downtown.
what about this girl?
she is too attractive to work here.
i agree. i think she should work
with us. undercover of course.
the point is there are
no unattractive women here.
where are the ordinary women?
 nowhere. this is a movie.
 no, this is california.
and thanks. it was sweet
the way you got that girl's number
okay, mr nonbeliever
i will take you to the house 
 where your cousin frank was tortured.
i have seen it on screen.
it is like that one.
but on the other side of the road.
it has an ocean view.
there is something
you do not understand.
this ticket is magic. any second
we will drive right into a theatre.
maybe i need to warm it up.
of course. my decoder ring has
to warm up all the time.
the house looked european.
like a postcard from italy.
like that one.
in fact, just like that one!
the bad guys are in there.
 i think you should wear this.
 i have not earned it yet.
you just solved the entire case
and revolutionised police training.
i have studied human character,
terrorist psyche, fingerprints.
i have taken courses in surveillance,
hostage negotiation and psychology.
and all i had to do was drive
around the neighbourhood 
 and point at a house and say:
the bad guys are in there.
trying to be funny?
yes. i am the famous comedian
arnold braunschweiger
 schwarzenegger
 gesundheit.
may i help you?
yes. could i speak to
the drug dealer of the house?
we are out killing drug dealers.
do you have any in the house?
be ready for anything.
where are you going?
i will be back.
you did not know i would say that.
 you always say that.
 i do?
everybody waits for you to say it.
it is like your calling card.
you are interested in
drug dealers?
jack, that is the henchman
with the glass eye.
 are you a henchman?
 no, i only go as far as lackey.
 anything else?
 take off your sunglasses.
 who is asking?
 the tin man.
 i suggest you hit the bricks.
 no. they are the wrong colour
oh, dear let us change them.
would arterial red suit you?
make no mistake.
they are very well trained.
i snap my fingers again and tomorrow
you emerge from several canine rectum.
or you and toto can go back to oz.
questions?
yes. two of them.
why am i wasting time on
a putz like you 
 when i could be doing something
dangerous like rearranging my socks?
and how will you snap your fingers
after i rip off both your thumbs?
have a nice day.
he had one with a bull'seye earlier
he calls his boss a sicilian schmuck.
how did slater find out?
will you tell me?
i want him to join me, but he
keeps going after the bad guys.
where is it written
that i am a bad guy?
find out who talked and have
him killed. then, slater
 what is it with you?
 we should call off the funeral.
are you crazy?
when i say blood bath, there is...
a blood bath.
i will find out more about
slater's short friend.
 he must be guilty of something.
 yes, of acting like an asshole.
if i arrest him,
i have to arrest congress.
 why did your park there?
 in case my ex-wife is here.
she is not.
her name was not in the credits.
 who does the doctor treat?
 patients.
 what is the elbow of my jacket doing?
 wearing thin?
bingo!
that was a stretch.
 do you drive this on the weekends?
 no, that is my girl's car
knock on the door
your ex-wife is not home.
her name was not in the credits.
meredith?
 i hope you mean whitney.
 sorry. whitney.
you are not skeezy, are you?
daddy!
 stop it, daddy!
 you have gained some weight.
hi. i am danny madigan
and my life has not been long yet.
but from now on,
it will all be downhill.
 you look wonderful.
 thank you.
so, who is your friend?
he is cute.
no, he is hopelessly insane.
he probably loved you in
gone with the wind.
 this is her first movie.
 do you see?
 who is skeezy?
 it is a sorority thing.
they assign you a freshman
and when he comes by you kiss him.
 do you have to kiss him?
 dad, come on!
if the phone rings for me, i will be
out of the shower in less than an hour
what a cutie.
that is old evidence.
counterfeit case. looks real, right?
it turns funny colours when you
burn it. i used it for alimony.
what is wrong?
you do not happen to have
a cigar, do you?
i will be back. i know.
dad! dad!
he would have been your age.
i know. the ripper pulled him
down off the roof three years ago.
 your dad saw everything.
 how do you know all that?
your dad is in the papers a lot.
i like crime stories.
 that is skeezy.
 i will get rid of him.
hello, toto.
there and there and there.
let go of me!
 good evening. is uncle jack here?
 he is off tracking a lead.
joe, would you teach her
the virtue of silence?
benedict, if you harm
a hair on her head...
stop!
you were saying?
now, i believe it was
sherlock holmes who said:
eliminate all logical
solutions to a problem 
 and the illogical becomes
invariably true.
i know your name is daniel madigan,
but how do you know mine?
slater showed me some mugshots.
we made your face easy.
daniel madigan from new york.
a long way from home.
 when did you get here?
 just.
then how do you know
what i said on the terrace?
i heard a recording.
 are there microphones in the statues?
 you would not believe how many.
 and the eye i was wearing?
 i saw it.
i saw it in a movie. there were
microcameras in the statues.
i have killed people smarter
and younger than you.
this is between you and slater
take the money in the desk 
 and leave me and meredith...
whitney, alone.
holy shit, boss.
it looks like two k in here.
just a minute. give it to me.
these bills are marked, right?
you tried to sucker me with them.
burn it.
 burn it?
 yes, burn it.
do not play games with grownups.
you will get hurt.
big mistake.
great, is it not?
i will hurt you a little bit.
freeze! lose the guns or i redecorate
in brain matter grey. got it?
kill me and i will kill him.
leave it. get the door
boss?
do not give up your day job.
jack!
do not leave home without it.
 where are you going?
 i have to catch the redeye.
i do not believe this.
i am in the movie and i am missing the action!
get the hell out of here!
back up the top!
next time we get thicker armour
like a tank.
chicken it is.
this is going to work.
it is a movie. i am a good guy.
i am a comedy sidekick.
oh, shit! it is not going to work!
 i think i scared them.
 you did great. come on.
benedict has the ticket.
too bad.
i wanted it for my collection.
you are travelling through
another dimension.
my name is skeezy.
skeezy.
say this.
 grow up.
 just say this one word.
 is it another movie proof?
 maybe.
 i do not want to say it.
 say what?
you cannot say it, because
this movie is pg13. admit it.
slater the guy with the missing eye,
i saw his license plate.
good for you.
 you mean the guy with the glass eye?
 no, when he ran it was missing.
it has got words.
vengeance is...
no!
did you catch that?
some of it may be english.
see if this is clear enough:
give me your badge!
and you will not get it back.
wohlschlger, team up with
the digitalised humphrey bogart.
are you making some changes?
why not come and work the funeral
with me? i would not miss it.
torelli has spent a bundle. he has
a helicopter circling the building.
a rooftop funeral in long beach.
how is that for taste?
 who died?
 leo the fart. shot yesterday.
somebody tried for torelli
and missed.
leo was tough. only he could not
sneak up on you.
if you change your mind,
i will be in front of the hotel.
 where are we, anyway?
 home.
how did you know
there was a guy in there?
there always is. it costs me
a fortune in closet doors.
like in slater ii 
the sagittarius strangler
soon you will meet the madigan
strangler i just got fired.
what you find so entertaining is my life.
i am not even a cop anymore.
he only took your badge, because you
destroyed more of the city than usual.
jack, you are everybody's hero.
it will all be okay again. trust me.
no, danny. it is getting harder
i only wanted to be a decent cop.
but i kept getting involved
in crazy adventures.
but the craziest part is,
i kept surviving.
these are the sequels.
they have to get harder
look on the good side.
you have a great daughter
and your ex-wife would not call
if she did not want you back.
do you think she cannot tell
the real voice from a taped one?
i pay a cashier to call me at work,
so the guys think i have a life.
my ex-wife is happily remarried.
she never calls.
and whitney. why can she not be
a normal teenager?
on prom night she stays home
to field strip an ak47.
she will die a young maid.
i am going to buy it soon, too.
no way. you cannot die
until the grosses go down.
vivaldi said something would
happen at a funeral.
we should look into
this funeral.
whatever
jack, it is a funeral
for a guy named fart.
funeral?
someone tried to kill torelli,
but hit leo the fart instead, right?
wrong. did benedict take the shot?
most likely. would he miss? no way.
 unless he wanted to miss.
 did he mean to miss? why?
because leo the fart was
very, very fat. get it?
no, i do not.
they broke in, cut leo open
and stuffed him with t.n.t.
he goes off at the funeral and
takes out the whole torelli mob.
that is what this is all about.
vivaldi will blow up that funeral.
it would not be a bomb. we have had
a dozen explosions in this movie.
do not start that again.
 nerve gas!
 what are you talking about?
some nerve gas has been stolen
from military trucks.
they could have put it inside him.
do you know what that means?
leo the fart will pass gas
one more time.
mr torelli.
i hope it is all right i am here.
i do not want to be a fourth wheel.
fifth wheel.
did you hear that, benedict?
family. go pay your respects.
 stay in the car.
 no, i am coming with you.
let us say this is a movie.
if someone says, stay in the car,
and the guy does not, what happens?
 he saves the day.
 or gets killed.
good point. i will stay.
wait a minute!
what if that gets me killed?
there is a gun in
the glove compartment.
 practice!
 makes perfect.
the fart is a bomb
to take out the torelli mob.
that explains the mortuary break in.
let us use the service entrance.
 who do you work for, john?
 what do you mean?
we both know there is
no side entrance to this hotel.
i am sorry, jack. i did not
want it to go down this way.
danny said not to trust you.
he said you killed moe zart.
 moe who?
 zart.
i kill many people.
i cannot remember them all.
how do you get to carnegie hall?
in a bodybag
if you do not drop that.
that is doubtful, kid.
real doubtful.
thank you for the fingerprints.
you are about to murder jack slater
chain yourself to that pipe.
these drug guys have more money
than the government.
so you cut a deal with
a scumbag like vivaldi.
vivaldi made up with torelli, but it
was a phoney. he will destroy him.
in exchange for leaving him alone,
he gives me a profit percentage.
i will be rich, jack.
you will be dead, but...
freeze!
toss me the cuffs.
you idiot. you made the classic
movie mistake. do not explain so much.
you had to get in a last few words.
had you fired, you would have won.
but you are the typical villain.
dumb.
you are no genius yourself, kid.
 the fart goes off in 7 minutes.
 get my car
move it.
i would love to stay and watch,
but i have to establish my alibi.
arrivederci.
did you want to save the day?
 you are not doing anything.
 i would steal your thunder
no, you stay here and make sure
everything goes as planned.
you have had slater in front of the
that is behind the 8ball.
you moron.
somebody once told me i talk
too much. no more words.
 whiskers! where have you been?
 sorry, jack. fur ball problem.
seal off the area. there will be
a chemical explosion in 5 minutes.
 thanks, whiskers. i owe you one.
 forget it. you have often saved me.
do you see the hook of that crane?
get it up on the roof in 2 minutes.
how do i do that?
help me move that crane!
i have to get it to the roof!
wait!
you have to work this thing!
i cannot even drive.
pardon me.
he was a good man.
a flatulent man.
do you hear this?
help me! get me out of here!
my god! this man is not dead!
get out of the way!
this man needs a doctor!
 this man needs a doctor!
 i am a doctor
are you a doctor?
check his chin.
the doctor has fainted.
can somebody help this man?
i will take the corpse...
the patient... look, an elephant!
do not shoot! he will drop leo!
do not shoot!
oh, shit!
that is a nofly zone, fellow.
danny! he is ticking!
move the crane as fast as you can!
danny, stop the crane now!
drop! go, go, go!
drop, you gas bag!
everybody out of here!
silent but deadly.
 bring the car around.
 the helicopter landed on it.
i hate when that happens.
tar actually sticks
to some people.
hey, dad!
i thought you could use some clothes.
thank you, honey.
 is this not a little convenient?
 you always said this was a movie.
so how did it go?
how did it go?
i am dying out here.
i want to know how it went.
how did it went?
splendid.
what?
it went splendidly.
i cannot hear you.
i do not want to miss a thing.
benedict, get your stuff.
was it beautiful?
perfect in every detail.
were the gas tanks okay?
like clockwork.
you should have been there.
men, women and children
dropping left and right.
wait, i want to enjoy it all.
come on, tell me.
they were writhing and screaming
and leaping to their doom to escape.
 really?
 no, i am lying.
it was a complete ballsup, and my
day has been terrible thanks to you.
what is this? you were my friend
and now you turn a 360 on me.
spaghettislurping cretin.
if i did a 360, i would end up
back where i started!
trust me.
if that turd daniel madigan can move
through parallel worlds, so can i.
in, steal whatever i want,
and out again. impossible to catch.
if god was a villain 
 he would be me.
 you want me to vacuum now?
 no. but the pool needs attention.
very good.
do not move.
 all right, i will go quietly, don't worry.
 the hell you will.
that was for blowing up
my cousin frank's house.
and this is for blowing up
my ex-wife's house.
but this is for
my daughter's black eye!
usually when i do that,
it leaves a hole.
the ticket.
jack, he has got the ticket!
it is the key to everything.
it is magic. see?
he has gone over to my world.
the door must still be open. come on!
i am not worried
that you are crazy anymore.
i am worried that you are right.
but if i go, how do i get back?
you cannot go through life
nitpicking everything. come on!
to hell with it.
there was nothing to it.
 we are still here.
 are you sure? look.
quickly!
 i want to see about nick.
 no time.
what the hell?
 we are in new york.
 it all makes sense.
actually, it makes no sense,
but i will explain. later
just be careful.
things are different here.
get out!
do not get feisty. the car
was a piece of junk anyway.
drive, bonehead!
here is another explosion
for your movie.
not one word.
 my hand hurts.
 things are different here.
smash a window with your hand
and it gets hurt.
great. could you not
have told me earlier?
 the taxis must be bulletproof.
 we have to get the ticket.
no way, slater listen to me.
it will not work.
you cannot play chicken
in real life. you will crash.
out of the car, amigo.
this is not the movies.
you have to reload guns...
 go, danny! get out!
 car crashes can kill you!
you are going to die!
jack!!
what did i do?
no, please...
damn, that hurt.
you are lucky to be alive,
you dumb idiot!
'89 mercury sable, standard air bag.
checker cab, no air bag. who is dumb?
 just make sure they are dead.
 give me a break. they are dead.
they always look dead.
in die hard a guy is hung 
 and at the end of the movie,
he comes back.
all right. make sure to cover me.
he may have a windshield wiper
maybe he used the ticket.
maybe it is on all the time now.
what is this place?
where am i now?
danny, do you have a place
i can sit down?
yes. come on.
nick!
danny, i was so worried.
are you okay?
did you see what happened?
no, i slept in here until i woke up
at 2 a.m. i figured you had gone home.
no, i was in the movie!
i am getting up in the years.
define in.
whitney kissed me! i drove a crane
and dropped leo the fart in a tar pit!
i was with jack slater
every step of the way!
oh, my god...
the ticket works?
all this time i never used it,
because i was too frightened.
but it is not too late.
i can still go visit.
garbo in camille.
jean harlow. boy, i had a crush.
monroe in bus stop.
forgive me for going on, sir
i admire your work greatly, too.
 nick, it is not who you think.
 you mean, it is...?
this is a wonderful moment,
mr slater
i have never met
a fictional character before.
how new and exciting
this must all be for you.
i have just found out
i am imaginary.
how would you like
to have been made up?
your job, your marriage, your kids.
let us push his son off the building.
you will have eternal nightmares,
but you are fictional, so who cares?
i do not find it new and exciting
that my whole life is a damn movie.
you are young and impressionable.
there are worse things than movies.
politicians, wars, forest fires.
famine, plague.
 sickness, pain, warts, politicians.
 you have already mentioned them.
i know. they are twice as bad
as anything else.
most of my life has been movies, too.
but that is all over for me now.
the theatre is shut.
soon it is the wrecking ball.
but now i have a new chance.
can i have the ticket back?
we have one little... hiccup.
 what do you mean?
 benedict has the ticket.
the madman with the glass eye?
 how are you getting back?
 good question.
but i would not want to
nitpick, right, danny?
just follow my lead.
where have you been?
do you know what time it is?
the police call,
you are nowhere to be found...
 mom, i am sorry, okay?
 okay?
there are kids with guns everywhere
and that is all you have to say?
 get in here!
 mom, wait.
you always say you wish
i had more friends. well...
hello, mrs. madigan.
arnold braunschweiger
sweetheart,
do you want to have a party?
 how old are you?
 still young enough to know how to party baby.
 forget it.
take his shoes, man!
take his shoes?
no screams.
no sirens.
excuse me!
excuse me.
i am sorry to bother you.
would you help me test a theory?
 sure. what can i do for you?
 well...
hello? i have just shot somebody.
i did it on purpose.
i said, i have murdered a man
and i want to confess.
shut up down there!
you look uncannily like him,
only you are much more intelligent.
good morning, good afternoon.
what kind of eggs do you want?
scrambled.
have you guys been up all night?
why did you not tell me
jack was a cop 
 and that you spent the night
looking at mug shots?
why did you not tell me
you had no friends?
and why do you go to the movies at
night and make your mother worried?
 you have turned him into a wimp.
 i think not. toast?
no thanks.
jack, are you okay?
we talked. i have never just talked
to a woman before. it is neat.
neat?
wimp. next they will be
talking about sex.
me and jack are going out.
i am helping him on a case.
oh, no. your licence to kill has expired.
come and eat some eggs.
i have to help. i am the only witness.
like in that harrison ford movie.
there is no comparison.
 we are not jewish.
 amish.
irene, do not worry.
there are 8 million in the city
and i am good at catching people.
and the future of the world
may be at stake...
can you turn this up?
 what is that?
 mozart.
 the guy practice killed?
 that is right, jack.
do you like classical music?
i do not know. i think i will.
 did you say who you really were?
 yes. a cop from l.a.
 i mean really.
 real enough. for now.
 are you going to catch him?
 i always catch everybody.
by spotting him from up here?
give me a break. it is the first
time i have been anyplace real.
this ticket, it worked in one movie.
could benedict use it again?
on other movies?
why would he do that?
i do not know.
but it is a start.
the possibilities are limitless.
but i have realised 
 that freedom would elude me
until jack slater was, 
 forgive the pun,
taken out of the picture.
and i thought
you might be inclined to help.
this must all be strange to you.
but if you do this right, 
 the world is your oyster
trust me.
you will be free to do whatever
you want beyond your wildest dreams.
and you will never have to go
back to this film again.
you have never heard
of this man, 
 but his actual name is
arnold schwarzenegger
there are a thousand theatres
and we have looked for 5 hours.
 we are close to catching him.
 no, to catching pneumonia.
in my world they just leave clues.
or they show up and kidnap me.
that stuff does not happen here,
because this world stinks!
the world is what you make of it.
you can give up and go home.
 you believed in me in the movies.
 but here you are just...
just what?
jack, there he is!
are you nuts?!
 you crazy asshole!
 he is just a cabbie!
in the movies they say make my day
or i am your worst nightmare.
rubberbabybuggybumpers.
you did not know i would say that!
 where did he go?
 he was reading a paper
 he has been going to the movies.
 that is not the half of it.
we are live from new york.
we are moments away from
the premiere of jack slater iv.
and here is the man
they have come to see.
it is arnold schwarzenegger
and his wife, maria shriver
 good to see you.
 are you a big fan of slater?
i have enjoyed it.
it was just beautiful.
the national enquirer
do not talk to them.
do not plug the restaurants.
i hate that. it is so tacky.
 why go to the movies?
 to get help.
benedict can do anything.
but we know who he is.
 so he must take us out.
 he cannot get to you.
he does not have to.
all he has to do is get to him.
 benedict will kill schwarzenegger
 who is slater
bingo!
in this movie we only kill 48 people.
in the last one we killed 119.
but we make up for it with a good
story, emotions, depth, dimensions.
there are thousands here tonight
and millions around the world.
 i directed and produced it.
 this guy is a success story.
 only in america.
 only in hollywood.
and at planet hollywood we have
some incredible memorabilia.
it is absolutely fabulous...
you embarrassed me.
how could you do that?
chris, it is the ripper
from jack slater iii. scary.
 let us axe him a question.
 look at this method villain.
rip, what brings you here?
 i thought i might kill someone.
 you should start with your designer
nobody wants to miss out.
the notables just keep coming.
excuse me, sir
could i see your invitation?
pete, it is okay. i am his agent.
jesus christ, tom. come here.
it is tom noonan,
the actor who played the ripper
are you nuts? do you want to
play axe killers for ever?
i need the manager's office for
what do you think
slater says about america?
i do not want to hear it.
i am not a big fan of arnold.
she is. arnold turns her on. i just
want to be there when it happens.
good, you have the props, too.
whip out a hibachi 
 and we can make some shishkebab.
i will rent you a tuxedo.
tell him it is me.
did nicholson go to the premiere of
batman dressed as the joker? no.
murray, get me your brotherinlaw.
yes, it is important.
 what do you think about this?
 i would never miss the premiere.
where am i sitting? where?
where am i sitting?
there are two balconies.
i believe you are in the lower one.
you stay here. and be careful.
someone should be checking
the other balcony. definitely.
arnold! the deal is done, right?
slater v. the soundtrack.
i will be...
jack, it is the ripper!
he has brought back the ripper!
benedict has brought back
the ripper!
everybody down!
get off me!
get the hell off me.
i should be informed
when there is to be a stunt.
you are the best lookalike
i have seen.
if you get to l.a., call my office.
we can get you jobs...
i do not like you.
you have only brought me pain.
jack, help!
did anyone come out of here?
did you see a crazy guy
with an axe?
hey, jack. what kept you?
 are you all right, danny?
 yes, sir
i tried to change, jack.
i really tried to do
what he told me to, but 
 i kept hearing that old music.
i knew you would come here, jack.
lose the piece.
there. it is between you and me.
so let the boy go.
we have played this number before.
what comes next?
you throw the gun away...
we have done that part.
and then you tell me to
let the kid go.
i am getting bored.
let us skip to the end.
come on, jack!
over here, right here!
i will be back!
the hell you will.
jack!
danny?
danny, i will be right there!
i am coming! hang on!
just hang on now.
 jack, help!
 i will be right there!
 i am coming!
 just hurry!
hold on, danny!
and do not look down!
oh, god, please do not
let him die.
listen, kid. you grab my hand
and we get out of here.
 i cannot, jack. i will fall.
 come on, now.
 trust me.
 i cannot do it.
listen to me. hold on with
your legs and let your hands go.
i will catch you. believe in me.
i will catch you. get my hand.
go for it, danny!
this hero stuff has its limits.
i need a hospital.
my shoulder is out of the socket.
will a morgue suffice?
get down, danny!
give it up, benedict.
the lobby is swarming with cops.
i think i can avoid them.
but if not, i have a little 
 explosive surprise for them.
since you are about to die, i will
tell you the plot. think of villains.
do you want dracula?
hang on.
i will fetch him. dracula?
i can get king kong.
a nightmare with freddy krueger
a party for adolf hitler
hannibal lecter can do the catering.
and a christening for rosemary's baby.
if i snap my fingers, they will come.
they are lining up. do you know why?
because in this world the bad guys
can win! i shall miss you, jack.
did you make a movie mistake?
you forgot to reload the gun.
no, jack.
i just left one chamber empty.
you broke my arm!
do you see, jack?
bad guys can win.
now!
no sequel for you.
the ticket.
take him home. to where
this is just a flesh wound.
do you not understand?
we must get him back to the movies.
i said: turn around!
great! they always run away!
hang on, jack.
 danny, do you know how to drive?
 sure. i have watched you, right?
get out of the way!
nick, fire up the projector!
slater is dying!
 do you have the ticket?
 no, but it has to work anyway!
hold on, jack. you will make it.
this is going to work.
it has to be here.
please. nick, hurry!
the door will not open.
no sweat, kid. you tried.
where are you going?
back off! you cannot have him.
i have had it with you, mister
who stays, who goes. this one stays!
i was only curious.
he is not on any of my lists.
though you are, daniel.
 now?
 oh, no. you die a grandfather
wait a minute! help us.
i know you can get him back.
i do not do fiction.
it is not my field. sorry.
you are a very brave young man.
unfortunately, you are not
very bright. if i were you 
 i would look for
the other half of the ticket.
they are all gold.
i have got it, jack!
i will get you home.
you cannot die.
i know.
until the grosses go down.
no! this will save us!
throw that silly thing away.
holy cow!
let us hear it for houdini!
slater!!!
has anybody seen slater?
i want him in my office right now!
help! somebody!
they got jack! doctor, move!
take this. get back
before it changes its mind.
no way.
i will not leave you.
i am an imaginary hero, danny.
you have a real life.
you are real to me.
you are the best. i need you...
here where you can always find me.
but i need you there to believe in me.
to take care of your mother
i would love to... you have
your whole life ahead of you.
and pimples
and premature ejaculation.
 what?
 it is just...
i am scared that i will
never see you again.
whoever thinks that would be
making a big mistake.
get out of the way.
do you want a doctor?
get out of the way.
i am a doctor
what happened?
is this a joke?
this is not even a flesh wound.
where the hell have you been?
where the hell have you been?
it is working again.
that door is coming out of
your meagre paycheck!
i have the eagle foundation doing
a tango up my hershey highway!
i do not care about your highway.
and stop shouting. i am not deaf!
you shout because it is in the script.
you are the comic relief.
and do you know what?
i am the hero. so shut up!!
hollywood writes our lives.
i do not want to shoot people
and blow up buildings anymore.
you did get to be a magician, nick.
it really does work.
the ticket is yours, danny.
and do you know what?
i think the magic was yours, too.
come on.
have i told you about the time
my dad took me to see buffalo bill?
we met sitting bull,
who was his medicine man.

 you're looking good, dutch.
 it's been a long time, general.
come on inside.
carrying a cabinet minister and his aide
from this charming little country.
we've got a transponder fixed
on their position... about here.
this cabinet minister, does he always travel
on the wrong side of the border?
apparently, they strayed off course.
we're fairly certain they're in guerrilla hands.
so why don't you use the regular army?
what do you need us for?
cos some damn fool
accused you of being the best.
dillon.
you son of a bitch.
what's the matter? the cia got you
pushing too many pencils?
 had enough?
 make it easy on yourself, dutch.
 never did know when to quit.
 damn good to see you, dutch.
 what is this fucking tie business?
 forget about my tie.
i heard about that job you pulled off in berlin.
very nice, dutch.
 good old days.
 yeah, like the good old days.
 then how come you passed on libya?
 that wasn't my style.
you got no style, dutch. you know that.
come on. why'd you pass?
we're a rescue team, not assassins.
now, what we gotta do?
that cabinet minister
is important to our scope of operations.
a couple of our friends are about to
get squeezed and we can't let that happen.
we need the best. that's why you're here.
 go on.
 simple setup. oneday operation.
we pick up their trail at the chopper,
grab those hostages, and bounce back.
 what do you mean, we?
 i'm goin' in with you, dutch.
general, my team always works alone.
you know that.
i'm afraid we all have our orders, major
once you reach your objective, dillon will
evaluate the situation and take charge.
delta onezero to two leader
rendezvous points and radio freqs
are indicated and fixed.
 awacs contact on fourhour intervals.
 who's our backup?
no such thing. this is a one way ticket.
once we cross that border, we're on our own.
this is getting better by the minute.
billy!
billy! the other day
i went up to my girlfriend. i said,
you know, i'd like a little pussy.
she said, me, too. mine's as big as a house.
you see, she wanted
a littler one cos hers was...
big as a house.
get that stinkin' shit out of my face.
bunch of slackjawed faggots around here.
this stuff'll make you
a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus,
just like me.
strap this on your sore ass, blain.
that was in '72. me and dutch both got one.
that's a real nasty habit you got there.
you got it, leader
never knew how much i missed this, dutch.
you never were that smart.
hawkins, you're up.
lines away.
the pilots have been shot in the head.
whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.
 took 'em out with a heat seeker
 there's something else, major
this is no ordinary army taxi.
it looks more like a surveillance bird to me.
 pick up the trail yet?
 billy's on it.
heat seeker, dillon. pretty sophisticated
for a bunch of halfassed mountain boys.
i guess they're getting
better equipped every day.
there were 12 guerrillas.
they took the two men from the helicopter,
but there's something else.
 what do you mean?
 six men wearing us-issued army boots.
they came in from the north,
and then they followed the guerrillas.
mean anything to you?
probably just another rebel patrol.
they operate in here all the time.
get ahead and see what you can find.
what's he got?
same business. guerrillas hauling
two guys from the chopper,
followed by men with american equipment.
do you remember afghanistan?
trying to forget it. come on.
holy mother of god.
jim hopper
mac, cut 'em down.
i knew these men.
green berets out of fort bragg.
what the hell were they doing here?
i don't know, dutch. this is inhuman.
nobody told me
there was an operation in this area.
 they shouldn't have been here.
 somebody sent them.
the guerrillas skinned them?
why did they skin them?
ain't no way for no soldier to die.
 what happened here, billy?
 strange, major
there was a firefight.
they were shooting in all directions.
i can't believe hopper
walked into an ambush.
i don't believe he did.
i can't find a single track.
 it just doesn't make sense.
 what about the rest of hopper's men?
there's no sign, sir
they never left here.
it's like they just disappeared.
stick with the guerrilla trail.
let's get the hostages.
we move, five metre spread. no sound.
it's time to let old painless out the bag.
payback time.
you're ghostin' us, motherfucker
i don't care who you are back in the world.
you give our position one more time,
i'll bleed you, real quiet, and leave you here.
got that?
fuck you.
he killed one of the hostages. we move.
mac, blain  the nest.
billy, poncho  the guard.
hawkins, dillon  backup.
as soon as they're set, i hit the fuel dump.
one down.
what the hell's he doin'?
what the fuck?
showtime, kid.
target's the centre of the palapa.
dutch, on your nine.
get that mother
stick around.
hostages inside.
knock, knock.
i got 'em.
hawkins, call in position and situation.
get con op on the hook.
you got it, major
shit.
mac. any sign of the other hostage?
found the other guy  he's dead, too 
and the gear from the chopper
but if they're central american,
i'm a goddamn chinaman.
from the looks of it, our cabinet minister was
cia. another thing, major we were lucky.
other guys they waxed...
were russian military advisers.
something pretty big
was gonna happen here.
good work, mac. clear the area. no traces.
get the men ready to move.
son of a bitch is dug in like an alabama tick.
 you're hit. you're bleedin', man.
 i ain't got time to bleed.
you got time to duck?
this is goddamn beautiful.
goddamn jackpot.
this is more than we ever thought we'd get.
we got those bastards.
 we got 'em.
 i think this is what you're looking for
you set us up. it's all bullshit. all of it.
the cabinet minister, the whole business.
got us in here to do your dirty work.
we stopped a major invasion.
in three days they'd have crossed the border
 why us?
 because nobody else could've pulled it off.
 you're pissed about the cover story.
 so, what story did you hand to hopper?
we've been looking for this place for months.
my men were in that chopper when it got hit.
 hopper went in and he disappeared.
 he didn't disappear he was skinned alive.
i had to get somebody
who could crack these bastards.
so you cooked up a story
and dropped the six of us in a meat grinder
what happened to you, dillon?
you used to be somebody i could trust.
i woke up.
why don't you?
you're an asset,
an expendable asset,
and i used you to get the job done. got it?
my men are not expendable.
and i don't do this kind of work.
major, we stepped into some real shit here.
we've got guerrillas all over the place.
can't be more than one, two miles away.
 how much time?
 half an hour, maybe less.
 tell mac we move in five.
 she goes with us. she's too valuable.
she'll give away our position
any chance she gets. no deal.
you're still under orders, major
now, you wanna make that call or should i?
she's your baggage.
you fall behind and you're on your own.
this place is too hot for a pickup. they won't
touch us till we get over the border
billy. give me a way out of this hole.
aerial says we are cut off.
the only way outta here
is that valley that leads to the east.
i wouldn't waste that on a broke-dick dog.
not much choice.
poncho, take lead. double-time it.
dillon.
over here.
 turn around.
 why?
thanks.
any time.
billy.
the other day
i was goin' down on my girlfriend.
i said to her, jeez, you've got a big pussy.
jeez, you've got a big pussy.
she said, why did you say that twice?
i said, i didn't.
see, it was cos of the echo.
over here.
turn around.
turn around. over here.
any time.
any time.
goddamn.
buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.
i've seen some badass bush before, man,
but nothin' like this.
i hear you. this shit's somethin'.
makes cambodia look like kansas.
hey, a little taste of home.
you lose it here, you're in a world of hurt.
come on. stop sandbaggin' it. now, get up.
come on, get up. would you get up?
maybe you'd better
put her on a leash, agent man.
try it again... please.
what's got billy so spooked?
can't say, major
been acting squirrely all morning.
that damn nose of his... it's weird.
what is it?
billy...
what the hell is wrong with you?
there's something in those trees.
do you see anything?
up there.
nothing.
what do you think?
i guess it's nothing, major
please.
please.
billy, break left.
mac, right.
 what the? this isn't her blood.
 what the hell'd you do to him?
major.. you'd better take a look at this.
did you find hawkins?
i...
i can't tell.
what in god's name?
i think it's hawkins.
 where the hell is his body?
 there's no sign of it.
ask her what happened.
she says the jungle...
it just came alive and took him.
bullshit. that's not what she said.
 it doesn't make sense.
 those sappers have followed us...
they've been in front of us. this woman...
hold it.
hold it. why didn't they take
his radio or his weapon?
why didn't she escape?
 hopper
 what?
they did the same thing to jim hopper
i want hawkins' body found. sweep pattern.
double back. 50 metres. let's go.
come on in, you fuckers.
come on in.
old painless is waitin'.
sergeant.
motherfucker
 what happened?
 i saw it.
 you saw what?
 i saw it.
blain.
no powder burns, no shrapnel.
the wound's all fused, cauterised.
what the hell could have done this to a man?
mac.
mac, look at me.
 who did this?
 i don't know, goddamn it.
i saw something.
not a thing. not a fuckin' trace.
no blood, no bodies. we hit nothing.
dillon, better get on the radio.
mac.
 sergeant.
 yes, sir
i want a defensive position above that ridge
mined with everything we've got.
 put him in his poncho. take him with us.
 i got him.
major, i set up flares, frags and claymores.
nothing's coming near this place
without tripping on somethin'.
thank you, sergeant.
mac.
he was a good soldier
he was...
my friend.
goodbye, bro.
blazer one, i repeat, extraction necessary.
say again, blazer one. say again.
request for extraction denied.
area is still compromised.
proceed to sector 3,000 for prisoner
extraction. priority, out. next contact 0930.
roger, blazer one. 1030 hours.
damn bastards.
they say we're still in too far
they can't risk coming in.
we're assets, dillon. expendable assets.
it comes with the job. i can accept it.
bullshit. you're just like the rest of us.
shitload of good a chopper's
gonna do us in here anyhow.
sergeant?
sergeant. who hit us today?
i don't know.
i only saw one of them camouflaged.
he was there.
those eyes disappeared.
what was that?
those eyes, they...
they disappeared.
i know one thing, major
i drew and fired straight at it.
capped off 200 rounds
in the minigun... full pack.
nothing... nothing on this earth
could have lived.
not at that range.
mac, you take first watch,
then you get some rest.
ask her ask her what she saw.
ask her what happened to hawkins.
go ahead. ask her
she says the same fuckin' thing.
the jungle, it came alive and took him.
billy... you know something. what is it?
 i'm scared, poncho.
 bullshit. you ain't afraid of no man.
there's something out there waiting for us,
and it ain't no man.
we're all gonna die.
he's losing his cool. there's a couple of
guys out there and we gotta take 'em down.
you still don't understand, dillon, do you?
whatever it is out there, it killed hopper,
and now it wants us.
here we are again, bro,
just you and me.
same kind of moon and same kind of jungle.
real number 10 night, remember?
whole platoon, 32 men chopped into meat,
and we walk out, just you and me.
nobody else. right on top, bro.
not a scratch. not a fuckin' scratch.
you know, whoever got you,
he'll come back again, and when he does,
i'm gonna cut your name right into him.
i'm gonna cut your name into him.
mac.
 this way.
 where the hell are you?
where are you?
where are you?
mac, where are you?
i'm right here you motherfucker!
jesus.
i got you, motherfucker
i killed you, you fuck.
jesus. you killed a pig.
do you think you could have found
something bigger?
fuck you, poncho. fuck you.
 where's the girl?
 shit.
why wasn't anybody watching her?
why didn't she try to get away?
look at her she's scared out of her mind.
major, you better take a look at this.
blain's body, it's gone.
it came in through the tripwires.
took it right out from under our noses.
that boar had to set off the trip flare, major,
cos there ain't no other tracks.
how could anyone get through this
and carry out blain without us knowing it?
and why didn't he try and kill one of us?
he came in to get the body.
he's killing us one at a time.
like a hunter
he's using the trees.
yesterday, what did you see?
 you're wasting your time.
 no more games.
i don't know what it was.
 it...
 go on.
it changed colors like the chameleon.
it uses the jungle.
are you sayin' blain and hawkins were killed
by a fuckin' lizard?
that's a bullshit psych job. there's two
or three men at the most. fucking lizard.
 what's your name?
 anna.
anna, this thing is hunting us. all of us.
you know that.
 what the hell are you doing?
 we need everyone.
 i'm taking her back. we're out of here.
 we're not going yet.
the rendezvous is 10 miles away.
you think the chopper'll wait?
dillon, we make a stand now, or there will be
nobody left to go to the chopper
there is something else.
when the big man was killed,
you must have wounded it.
its blood was on the leaves.
if it bleeds, we can kill it.
look out.
you really think
this boy scout bullshit's gonna work.
it can see our tripwires.
maybe it can't see this.
instead of complaining,
maybe you should help.
what makes you think
he'll come in through here?
there are tripwires on every tree for 50 yards.
this is the only way in.
when i was little, we found a man.
he looked like,
like, butchered.
the old women in the village
crossed themselves
and whispered crazy things,
said strange things.
only in the hottest years this happens.
and this year it grows hot.
we begin finding our men.
we found them sometimes without their skin,
and sometimes much, much worse.
el que hace trofeos de los hombres means
the demon who makes trophies of man.
so, what you gonna try next? cheese?
hey, dutch!
shit.
got you, motherfucker i got you.
i'm coming.
mac. mac. get ramirez on his feet
and get to the chopper
 hold it. i'm going after mac.
 that's not your style, dillon.
i picked up some bad habits from you.
get your people the hell outta here.
you can't win this, dillon.
maybe i can get even.
dillon.
just hold on to that damn chopper
he's busted up pretty bad, major
 i can make it. i can make it.
 get the radio. forget the rest.
come on, poncho.
long tall sally
she's built sweet
she got everything that uncle john need
oh, baby
baby
i'm gonna have me some fun
i'm gonna have me some fun
turn around.
over here.
over here.
mac?
out there. past them trees.
you see it?
i see you.
i see it.
i see it.
you know, we can get this thing, mac.
you work your way down there toward him.
i'll get in back of him, flush him toward you.
when i flush that son of a bitch, you nail him.
i got a score to settle.
we've both got scores to settle.
come on. quickly. hurry up.
don't. leave it.
it didn't kill you because you weren't armed.
no sport.
mac.
any time.
let's go.
billy.
billy, let's go.
give me the weapon.
no.
run.
run.
go.
get to the chopper
oh, shit.
he couldn't see me.
bleed, bastard.
you're one ugly motherfucker
bad idea.
come on.
come on. do it.
do it.
come on. come on.
kill me. i'm here. kill me.
i'm here. kill me.
come on. kill me. i'm here.
come on. do it now. kill me.
what the hell are you?
what the hell are you?
what the?
my god.

 green light.
 let's go.
how many times was john wayne nominated
for an academy award?
probably not enough.
marcellino's still asleep.
 i'm gonna go relieve ed.
 how the hell can one son of a bitch sleep so much?
 fear
 as long as he wakes up to testify.
oh, no.
we've been looking for you.
so you want to be a witness?
witness this.
his birthday
was in two weeks.
harry, they wanna
take him out.
harry?
twenty-seven years of this shit,
and i never got a scratch. jesus christ.
i want a list of everybody
in witness protection...
who knew we
were holding marcellino...
and anybody else
who could've known...
from the district attorney
to the commissioner
they're dead, mike.
whoever set this up...
whatever it takes...
they're dead.
okay, cullen. you're outta here.
now you're off and runnin
runnin like you're scared
runnin under radar
runnin like a deer
somethin in the bushes
starin out at you
starin at your feelings
feelin like you do
one way rider
wanderin down the road
baby, i'm right beside you
everywhere you go
once upon a daydream
circumstances do
everything to hold on
everything for you
first we found a loser
next we found a fool
now we follow footsteps
taken up on you
one way driver
one way down the road
 baby, i'm right beside you
 hey, you goddamn son of a...
everywhere you go
 whoa!
 damn!
yes, sir well, a number
of the residents have complained...
though, about the trash around the dumpster,
so i think you should do something about it.
yes, sir heh! all right.
have a good day then.
 you caught the bastard.
 in the act.
bullshit. i was on my way
to a costume party.
he stopped somebody over at route 74
for driving too fast.
 he was going to let them off for 50 bucks.
 they stopped me for directions.
book him.
impersonating an officer,
resisting arrest...
fraud, reckless driving
and lying to the sheriff.
 i'll be at home if you need me.
 okay, sheriff.
come on, deputy dawg.
amy! amy!
amy?
amy?
 are we having a party?
 of course...
and i'm glad you're home early
to join in the celebration.
is it just gonna be us,
or are we gonna have company?
be serious. of course it's just us.
so, what are we celebrating?
commemorating...
our fifth year
five years in exile.
five years in a town without...
having found anybody who could talk
about anything except...
crops and the weather
 it's not gonna be forever
 the hell it's not.
christ, amy, this is old news.
let it go.
 i did the best i could.
 the hell you did.
you could still be with the bureau.
you could've fought it.
we could still be living in new york.
you did not have to quit!
they gave me a chance to resign.
if it would've gone to trial...
i would've lost
and they would've kicked me out.
i wouldn't have even had
the chance to get this job!
what are we having
for dinner?
just this.
this is gonna make us fat.
you think because we're in shape
we're not already fat?
we're like all the cows
they raise around here.
stuck.
victims of circumstance.
and you know what a cow's
biggest contribution to this world is?
you should not drink
and bake.
hello, mark.
 yeah?
 it's shannon, mark. harry shannon.
it's been a long time, harry.
what's going on?
i want to talk to you, mark.
i got trouble.
 talk.
 no. not on the telephone.
it's all i've got time for
things aren't so good,
huh, kid?
seen better days.
if you wanna see 'em again,
meet me.
the bureau always arranges
such intriguing meeting places.
this has nothing to do with the bureau.
mr patrovita,
you deny any sources of illicit income...
any connection at all
with organized crime...
yet your reported income
for this past year was $73,000...
with which you somehow
managed to maintain...
a seven bedroom mansion
here in chicago...
a hunting lodge in wisconsin...
a winter resort in california...
four cadillacs that we know of...
and a lifestyle that makes
ted turner look like a derelict.
now, can you explain
how you manage this?
i think it'd be of particular interest
to those of us...
 on fixed incomes.
 hold it. that's baxter
 i know, i know.
 what the hell has he got to do with it?
 he's special federal prosecutor
 that son of a bitch cost me a career
you brought in a suspect with
half the bones in his body broken.
 any prosecutor would've gone after you.
 oh, you remember the case.
the guy kidnapped
an 11-year-old girl.
he molested, murdered
and mutilated her
well, the public wasn't too keen
on heavy-handed cops at that time.
baxter was out
to nail me to the wall.
 i went to see him, tried to tell him what happened...
 what did he say?
resign or be prosecuted.
any way you want it.
yeah, well,
the good news is that...
he's giving patrovita a lot more shit
than he ever gave you.
i got a lotta debts.
uhhuh. to whom?
 friends.
 like paulo rocca and bill rusman?
i plead the fifth amendment.
that's lu patrovita.
he runs the strongest
of the chicago families.
 mr rocca,
your stated source of income...
is a travel agency, yet you,
like mr patrovita...
seem to, uh, have a lifestyle
that far exceeds your income.
would you mind shedding some light
for us on what seems to be...
some extraordinary
money management here?
i'll take the fifth on this,
on whatever you're gonna ask me next...
and everything after that.
honest men don't have to tolerate
this kind of harassment in this country.
thank you, mr rocca,
for reminding us of our inalienable rights.
rocca is the undertaker
anybody bothers patrovita,
this one buries 'em in the gravel pit.
so we did who's who in chicago. you're the one
in the bureau. what do you want from me?
do, uh...
do you remember my son?
blair yeah. we went to
some ball games with him.
 yeah, that's right.
 he joined the bureau, didn't he?
yep.
how is he?
dead.
i want patrovita.
 he killed blair?
 blair was covering a government aide...
a witness who could've
put the bastard away forever
no.
no, he had
somebody do it.
there's nothing that a small-town sheriff
can do that you can't.
oh, no, no. the bureau
has nothing to do with this.
no, i'm financing
this myself.
i have $45,000
in savings.
i want you to get inside the patrovita
organization and tear it up.
who do you think i look like?
dirty harry?
 i think you look like an unhappy man.
 you have a cure?
possible reinstatement.
get back into the bureau.
 hmm?
 how?
the bureau's been trying to get somebody
inside of patrovita's family for over a year..
but there's
a big leak somewhere.
all our guys
keep getting nailed.
that's why no one but me
will know about you. nobody.
now, you do a good job, you pull this off,
and you've got a great shot.
now, what do you say?
do you think i'd
still pass the physical?
this is kaminski, investigating a breakin
at the petrolcam storage yard.
roger, sheriff. we copy.
i'm sorry you had to kill yourself off, kid...
but it's safer
for everybody that way.
the top slot
is luigi patrovita.
he's been up there for over 20 years.
he's smart.
buried a marching band
getting where he is.
his right arm is
a guy named rocca.
he'd kill for table scraps.
him you watch close.
the false i.d. corresponds
to a guy...
in the n.c.i. computer
with a bad rap sheet.
the phone number
is a safe house...
where an answering machine
is set up to catch your bulletins.
there's $25,000 for initial expenses;
more if you need it.
the squat-face guy is a new kid on the block.
his name is hammer lamanski.
he's been biting off
little pieces of patrovita's pie.
doing damage to him
is probably your quickest way...
to catch the big mars eye.
remember, there's a leak.
he's the one
who got blair killed.
he's the one i want.
well, see ya in chicago.
big player, number eight!
place your bets. place your bets.
place your bets.
place your bets.
place your bets.
all bets down.
all bets down.
throw the dice!
seven! you lose.
come and get another number
come and get
another number
i don't think the table is straight.
i want to see mr lamanski.
he's not around, pal. and all losers
don't think a table is straight.
i'm still right.
oh, shit! yeah? so what?
looks like the table's fixed.
this table's fixed! you scumbag! hey, look
at that! that's bullshit! that's my money!
 magic or magnet?
 rudy! rudy!
hey, you! get outta here!
scram!

hey! wait up!
guys, make sure to clean up the mess
before you knock off, okay?
i'm gonna kill
that bastard.
excuse me. could you move
to the side a little bit?
 your lights.
 thank you.
oh, shit!
it's costing us a lot of money
to get together like this...
because now my time
is worth as much as yours.
worth more.
 you got less of it.
 i gave you the courtesy of this talk...
because you worked
for me a long time.
like i said,
close down everything and get out...
or one morning you
are gonna wake up dead.
luigi, i got employees, obligations...
there's plenty for both of us.
there's no both of us. 
there's just me.
 you got two days.
 and then what? back to work for you?
you don't work around here
anymore for me...
or anybody.
auggie, let's move one out.
you got it.
get down! move it!
fucking lamanski! who the hell
does that son of a bitch think he is?
 he thinks he can take me out just like that?
 come on!
that bastard's crazy!
he's a fucking amateur!
he learned nothing from me!
 i'm still okay, right?
 yeah.
just a waste
of fucking bullets.
tony was a good kid.
make sure you get
a good replacement for him.
you son of a bitch!
 hey, you got the wrong car, pal.
 shut up.
hey, you know
who it belongs to?
yeah, a guy who is probably gonna be dead
before it's out of warranty.
 what are you doing here?
 waiting for you. drive.
 what do you want?
 take off all your jewelry.
 do you know who bought all this stuff?
 martin lamanski.
he has good taste in jewelry,
but you've a rotten taste in men.
come on.
gonna mess up your hair
attagirl. keep going.
fuckin shit!
you took my lunch, you son of a bitch!
good evening, sir
down.
 there is no down.
 hey, i'm not a cop.
i'm a player
 a martini on me.
 get you a drink?
 oh, bartender
 yes, sir, a manhattan.
yeah, another one.
what do you need?
couple of minutes
with mr rocca.
 not possible.
 tell him i'm the pain in lamanski's ass.
wait here.
 you're working for morgan and company, right?
 richard's supposed to meet us.
ladies and gentlemen,
place your bets.
cards?
 losing improves your character
 winning improves your wardrobe.
again, place your bets,
ladies and gentlemen.
cards?
go on in.
what's your name?
joseph p. brenner..
joey.
and you're the pain
in lamanski's ass, huh?
wasted one of his joints
and took down a couple of his bag men.
and this stuff
comes from his girlfriend.
what'd you bother
with that for?
intimidation.
let him know that nothing is safe.
what are you
trying to prove?
joey, this is max keller
max takes care of things...
all kinds of things.
 trying to prove that maybe you can use me.
 for what?
to take care of things...
all kinds of things.
that job's filled.
i'm sure a smart man like mr rocca
is always looking to upgrade.
 i'm the best there is.
 max...
if you're the best there is,
the wheel would've never been invented.
 how'd you know i was looking for somebody?
 i didn't.
i thought
i might get lucky.
where're you from?
the last few years?
miami.
 your references?
 i'm in the computer
i'm sure you can find a couple of cops
that can punch it up for you.
what makes you think i'd be happy
to see lamanski's ass kicked?
you see, in miami, we can tell everything
by the flow of the blow.
this lamanski has been making
bigger buys every week.
now, i know he has been
biting into someone's action.
go see the cashier
she'll give you a thousand dollars
in chips. enjoy yourself.
in case you forget,
i'll be checking back with you.
i don't believe
a fucking word he said.
girl scouts build character..
and it's a lot cheaper
you pester me,
i'll have you tossed out.
you have that kind
of clout around here?
 they know me.
 i envy them.
 place your bets.
 i'm sure nobody will mind if you go home before you're broke.
don't trouble yourself over my money.
i always get more.
getting it somewhere else
might change your luck.
where the hell
do you think he's goin?
takira leak?
he's in here? perfect!
if any more guys duck down that alley,
we're gonna start sellin tickets.
 where'd he go?
 this way.
come on, come on!
come on!
forget it!
 hurry up!
 wait up!
 any trouble?
 oh, nothing special.
 all these alleys probably have rats.
 you got some i.d.?
sure.
saw those three guys
leave the hotel after ya.
anything particular
or, uh, just a mugging?
they had trouble telling me
what they wanted.
yeah, i'll bet.
joseph p. brenner
what's the p stand for?
pussy.
see ya around.
harry, everything is
moving along fine.
the apartment is okay.
i'm renting a car tomorrow.
something happened last night
that got me thinking.
i might get into a spot
where a cop is shooting at me.
any idea how
i ought to handle it?
three backbusters jumped me.
i have a feeling that max keller
had something to do with it.
rocca is probably checking on me
as i talk. i'll stay in touch.
hi.
when was the last time
you had a good piss?
hey, let me in. i gotta take a leak.
 freeze!
 don't move!
 hold it right there!
 in the back room! cover me!
 we got 'em now!
 let's get out of here!
freeze!
 hey, what the...
 hold it!
throw it!
 you got a paper?
 i got a warrant. you got your rights.
patrovita's got
a big fuckin headache.
call the president.
i think we just fixed the deficit.
that's $100 million
on the street.
we can make it up
in a couple of weeks.
just what
lamanski needed.
if he's got a lot of shit on hand,
he's gonna step in at bargain prices...
and grab a great big chunk
of the business!
well, why don't we
just take him out?
because he's
looking for it!
you won't get near him now,
unless you want to start a war
nobody needs that.
later
 how many got busted?
 eight.
nobody pulled a trigger
they'll all make bail.
have you found
a replacement for tony?
i'm looking somebody over
 i want it back.
 what?
the money. the smack.
it's mine. i want it back.
oh, come on! what are we gonna do,
knock over city hall?
we don't even know
where they got it stashed.
but we know somebody
who can tell us.
that shit is mine.
i paid for it, and i want it back.
and i'm gonna get it back.
how the hell is it
you never did any time?
i'm smart,
unlike someone we know.
max thinks you stink
from trouble.
 he doesn't want you around.
 i'm sure he makes a lot of mistakes.
never the same one twice.
you're on.
but consider yourself temporary.
and if max is right,
very temporary.
we start tomorrow.
it's nice to be
one of the family.
 get my car, please.
 yes, sir
sam, could you
get me a cab, please?
taxi!
how'd you do
the other night?
 your money didn't change a thing.
 and tonight?
i got out with cab fare.
maybe you should try
a different kind of recreation.
losing at tennis
wouldn't make me feel any better
the exercise might.
 we don't need you.
 thanks, pal.
okay. thank you.
you're a real
takecharge guy.
hold your glass very still.
oh. i don't know why they advertise
all those sleeping pills on television.
i mean, chemicals are
no good for you.
a couple of bottles of champagne
wipes you right out.
exactly.
what are you sayin?
are you sayin you're ready for bed?
 i think so.
 that sounds like a hell of an idea to me.
gonna help you get up.
uuh! god!
 here.
 there you go.
there you go.
come on. hurry.
oh, god!
 you know what i like about bedrooms?
 no. what?
you almost always
find a bed in there.
you know what?
i've noticed
the same thing.
oh, my god.
great.
i've got what there is.
joseph p. brenner
social security number, 5673...
567345787
dade county license number..
passport number..
h1032642.
okay? he's asleep.
he's passed out.
this takes care of a thousand dollars
of my i.o.u., right?
okay.
if there's something to say,
i'll call.
we wanted to check
your water heater today, sarah...
but the, uh, keys werent where they were
supposed to be, so we couldn't do anything.
if you tell us where the keys have been moved,
we'll come back and take care of it.
look, come back to me
as quick as you can.
yeah, you don't want
to freeze to death in that water
 fucking little worm.
 what's his problem?
we give him a million dollars
to tell us where to hit marcellino.
now the son of a bitch
is pulling back.
well, maybe he doesn't know
where the shit is stored.
how many places do you think the cops
can store that much cash and smack, huh?
if he doesn't know it,
he'll find out.
or maybe he just doesn't like
what you're planning.
i'm supposed to give a shit
what he thinks?
no, he'll come across.
what the hell's his choice?
 he's in up to his ass.
 there's no way i can talk you out of this?
if you could, i shouldn't be where i am.
when we start thinking
there's something we can't do...
something that's too big or too messy,
then we oughtta get out.
this is like wrestling.
it's fixed.
and the cops are always gonna lose,
and they know it.
i wanna hear you say
you're sorry
nobody takes advantage of me
over here, honey.
jeanine! over here!
if looks could kill
you'd be lyin on the floor
you'd be beggin me
please, please
baby, don't you
hurt me no more
 where's metzger?
 i haven't seen him.
 how's business?
 we're dying.
we're livin on the edge
hangin by a thread
i'm watchin every move
you make
you don't wanna see my anger
so don't you make
another mistake
that's him!
that's a harmless, empty threat
hey! watch it!
 stop it!
 asshole!
 if looks could kill 
do you mind?  come on!
 you'd be lyin on the floor
 cut it out!
 hey, you cretin!
 you'd be beggin me, please, please
 oh, god!
 baby, don't hurt me no more
uh! no, no! no, please!
come here!
 help me!
 come here!
i hear you're paying off everybody
but the fucking government.
 lamanski says pay him. he'll come back with a torch.
 so you decided to pay us both.
 is that it? i didn't know you had so much loose cash.
 just stay out of it.
 no. i'm gonna close down.
 oh, yeah? you try it, all right?
you piece of shit!
 uh!
 ah! do something, huh?
 oh, my god!
 this is what you're gonna look like dead.
don't pay lamanski anymore.
if i torch this shithouse,
you'll be inside it.
get in my way again,
and i'll kill ya.
i hope you're not
your mother's only child.
ohh! oh, mr metzger,
are you all right?
if looks could
kill
 i didn't think you were this twisted.
 twisted? this is kid stuff.
we got a call. somebody thought
there was some trouble here.
oh, the boys were having
some trouble with their makeup.
joey p. brenner you turn up
in the most damnedest places.
trying to learn
my way around.
well, you got a good guide if you wanna
know your way around a sewer
if looks could kill
 where do you know that cop from?
 oh, he broke up a fight i had in an alley...
the night you sent your three assholes
to take me apart.
we don't know what his name is yet...
but he's definitely
working for patrovita.
 i don't want his name. i want his ass.
 i'll see to it he disappears.
first you bust him up real good,
public and messy.
everybody should know what you get
when you kick in my door
shit, i hate this game.
this looks like
it's going to be fun.
 that'd be different.
 why? he's not a good host?
some of his friends
can be a pain in the neck.
hey, you're with
the main man.
if you have any trouble, you let me know.
 wear that one.
 beautiful, beautiful. give it some sparkle.
 such a pretty dress.
 oh, like this?
joey.
i was hoping
you could make it.
monique.
 quite a party.
 party?
this is just a simple gathering
of the immediate family.
luigi's parties
have to be held outdoors.
he wants to meet you.
be right back.
hey, you guys having fun? i'm having a lot of fun.
let's capture the moment here,
huh? come on.
max, maybe you're
having too much fun.
eat something.
 i'll get you a nice eight by ten.
 keep it. i'm not sentimental.
i didn't think so.
come in.
 joey brenner, luigi patrovita.
 my pleasure.
you like getting close
to our friend?
you want the job
done right, don't you?
 what have you found out?
 nothing.
i want you.
we tried that,
remember?
you come home with me,
and you owe nobody nothing.
i'll owe you,
won't i?
mr rocca thinks you would make
a worthwhile addition...
 to our various endeavors.
 i like to think so.
 oh, you're a thinker
 sometimes.
not enough to get me
into any trouble.
from what we know,
you don't stay anyplace too long.
if you're not part of an organization
that can protect you...
 moving around is the next best thing.
 he's looking for a home.
you kill anybody, joey?
yeah.
more than one?
three. you want names
and addresses?
smart, i like.
smartass, i don't.
all right. forget it. go back to the party.
i want to talk to mr rocca.
nice meeting you.
i don't know.
you don't let him in
too far too fast.
give him a little time
to impress us.
if he doesn't, we'll use him for
something dirty and dump him in the pit.
cute, huh?
what a doll.
yes, i think it would accessorize
the outfit beautifully.
what do you think?
does it make you drool?
i would have picked exactly
the same one. that is my taste.
yeah? do you like
this one better?
 what do you think? which one do you like better?
 try it on.
 you don't mind sitting here?
 no. i like it.
 okay. all right. i'll see you later
 bye.
all right.
 well, this goes with the color it's beautiful.
 something in red?
well, i think it's something...
it's just... red.
why don't you just pick one?
i'll never make up my mind.
 why don't you take them both?
 i can't afford them both.
i can.
oh. you do that
too easy.
you always buying things
for the ladies?
 no. not in a long time.
 kiss her goodbye, shithead.
it's a stickup.
 call security.
 oh, really?
just dial, dipshit!
we're being robbed
and beaten!
out of my way, bitch!
i'm very hard to fit.
 this way!
 no, this way!
we're finished
shopping!
yeah? well, come up with something!
if it was possible, luigi,
and i'm not so sure it is...
it's gonna take a lot of work
to pull this thing off.
 a lot of planning.
 look. we get a floor plan.
we buy ourselves
an inside man and we go.
our boy not only told me
where it is...
he told me they're moving it to a federal
depository for safekeeping next tuesday.
 oh, jesus. this is crazy!
 look, last week in new york...
$10 million worth of cocaine
walked out of a police station.
 nobody knows where the hell it is! it can be done.
 that was inside work.
i'm talking
a major fucking job here!
it'll make brinks
look like rolling a drunk.
there's 50 cops in that building any hour of
the day. how you gonna get 'em outta there?
give 'em tickets
to the ball game?
a bomb.
just blow the place up, huh?
the genius.
what are you
talking about?
bomb threat. whenever they get one,
they have to evacuate the whole building.
yeah, sure.
if they believe it.
they get that shit all the time.
how you gonna guarantee they'd bite?
make them nervous.
make them believe someone is trying
to blow up every police station in the city.
 hey! where you going?
 filling the vending machine.
 where's bobby?
 ha! that's what the boss would like to know.
hey, you guys bigger on
potato or corn chips?
the guys in the 6th don't touch the corn.
 9th district, sergeant mora.
 myself, i don't care, you know.
okay, lady. where are you?
anybody hurt?
all right. someone will be out
over there in a little while.
well, it doesn't look like
they intended too much damage.
there's always the chance
the guy was a bad bomb maker
 what're you doin here, harry?
 oh, just hopin that some...
halfassed, prolife,
whale-lovin terrorist didn't do it...
so the bureau doesn't have to get involved,
and we can leave it in your good hands.
 hmm.
 it's crude. it's very crude.
how are ya, harry?
hello, marvin. yeah, i'm getting better
how about yourself?
 well, complaining doesn't make any difference, huh?
 come get a shot of this.
so, what do you figure
this was?
well, he thinks somebody was mad
at the vending machine.
uh, look, you two kibbutz
somewhere else.
 you're impeding criminal science.
 yes, yes, right.
so, how goes
your patrovita case?
i find new angles
every day.
believe me, he'll run out of options
before we run out of patience.
 i already have.
 nobody can blame you.
somebody said
they took you off this case.
well, they don't control
all the hours of my day.
don't mess around, harry. we might have
something workin that you don't know about.
my guess is that whatever
you've got workin... won't work.
we're doin all we can.
great. so am i.
i know with you it's personal, but we're
both after the same thing... justice.
right, harry?
justice.
fuck justice!
allow me.
there you go.
i don't really
want to lose you
but i don't want to go
what's new on
the domestic front?
i don't have the report
typed out yet.
i can tell the way they act
and their attitude
remember that horse we used to look at?
i bought it.
what's on your mind, max?
you.
what can he do for you
i can't?
this was your idea,
not mine.
well, i didn't expect it
to go this far
how far has it gone?
does he climb into your pants
five times a day?
is that what you wanna hear?
not really.
i'd like to know it was me.
the only way you'll ever end up lying next
to me is if we're run down by the same car.
i like it when
you hurt me, baby.
myself...
i'd rather give
than receive.
wrong.
ever think about
ever settling down
max...
i don't think we're going to be
the kind of pals i hoped we'd be.
if a tear rolls from my eyes
i feel the hurt inside
as i reach out to you
i'm impressed.
i'm hungry.
i can't get out
you see, i'm tied
 the more we know each other,
the less you wanna see me.
is this an approach you developed yourself,
or something you read in a book?
these guys from the dress shop
are going to be back...
and i don't want you around
when they do.
i like you.
maybe more than you like me.
i don't know.
unless you're gonna tell me you're married
or something, i'm not staying away.
you're married?
for a long time.
where is she?
far away from here.
well...
that's a relief.
i thought i lost it.
all this great equipment,
and you're sitting on your hands.
i was telling myself, he's a slow starter,
but it gets hot when he gets going. 
you're important to me.
you are a friend.
 you're more than a friend.
 friend. 
 you're more than that.
 we're friends.
when i wanna make friends,
i'll go to summer camp.
you wanna hear
something funny?
i was sort of flattered.
i thought you were going slow because
you thought this was real important...
and you didn't
wanna blow it.
it's gonna take me a long time to figure out
which of us is the biggest asshole.
god! they don't make 'em like that anymore.
the whole thing
could blow up.
patrovita's gonna get lamanski.
as long as they keep cutting down
the right people, i don't give a shit.
patrovita wants the money and the dope
the cops got when they raided him.
and he's gonna try
and get it.
you're kidding.
you know what happens
if we stop this?
yeah. since i'm the new boy,
they must figure that i'm the leak.
let 'em have it.
this is not the reason we're in this.
 what about lamanski?
 considering how we're involved in this...
i can't be of much
help to you, mark.
you're gonna have to
watch out for yourself.
you want out?
i started to call amy
last night.
 i wanted her to know that i'm still alive.
 dangerous.
yeah. but i've
put her through a lot.
but if we stop now,
the whole thing is for nothing.
and knowing amy...
she probably
will kill me herself.
are you gonna stick?
this joey has
a pretty good life.
expensive clothes,
a nice car..
lots of money
and free time.
i never had it so good.
just don't let it go
to your head, all right?
that's kind of sudden.
you don't work good
on short notice?
nothing works
if it isn't thought out.
they hit the 3rd district
in an hour
we'll waste lamanski
as a diversion.
it's my idea.
what do you think?
i'll let you know
when it's over
we're ready.
sergeant washington.
you've got a bomb
inside the building.
it goes off in 22 minutes.
all right.
everything's jammed.
we have a bomb.
call bomb disposal.
clear the building.
bomb disposal.
evacuate and barricade a perimeter
of 300 feet from the building.
we're on the way.
we're go.
so are we.
clear those people! come on!
come on. let's keep moving.
come on, come on, come on!
let's go!
let's go! let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!
watch out! watch where you're going!
 come on! come on!
 let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
it's right down here.
torch!
come on!
you see him?
lamanski.
take him when he's clear
shit! no way.
where the fuck did all
those people come from?
maybe they play bingo.
do you own a calendar, max?
i bet it's a jewish holiday.
yeah, well, for his sake,
it better be the day of atonement.
we'll follow him
and take him when we can.
all right. that's it.
he's ready. outta here.
we're set.
oh, shit.
that's good.
guys, we're on the clock.
 come on.
 here, fill this one.
when we get to the expressway,
i'm gonna run him off the road.
their car is much
heavier than ours.
wont matter
if you hit the driver
run 'em into the wall.
let's get outta here!
wave your hands!
 let's go, let's go.
 this is it. let's make it look good.
open the doors!
 clear!
 what happened in there?
stay clear!
i don't know who in the hell
this guy is.
 i've never seen him before.
 no mistake?
come on. three years ago,
i busted joey brenner twice in two weeks.
and that ain't him.
you know where he is?
caribbean, i heard.
when do you go back
to miami?
in an hour
i've got a charity softball game with
dade county sheriffs in the morning.
cops against cops.
you leave me no one
to root for
so what the fuck are you
doing for the money?
 sticking my ass out.
 not far enough!
somebody got somebody inside.
he's walking
all over the place.
he's even been to my house.
he could be banging my wife,
for christ's sake!
he didn't get by me.
i don't know how the hell he got there.
what the hell's the difference?
we got him, right?
don't give me that we shit!
max turned him up on his own.
what do you want?
i can't tell you things i don't know about.
well, what do
you know about?
you're telling me
about this bureau creep...
who's trying to take me apart
in his spare time...
because his kid got smacked
when we took marcellino.
so what's the good news?
i had a friend at the bureau
check harry shannons case files.
whatever he's doing is unofficial.
there aren't any records.
if he were killed, there could be
no direct connection to you.
oh. that's the good news, huh?
so who's gonna do it?
you?
brenner
yeah.
i think i'd better
get going.
yeah? where?
canada? mexico?
you're not getting out of my sight
until this is over and done.
if you did some serious damage
to my organization...
i wanna know where
i can lay my hands on you.
i'll be right back.
 hey! we can't be late!
 just a minute!
what are you doing here?
sorry for the other night.
 where would i learn how to deal with a friend?
 it's okay.
let's go!
i was thinking
maybe we could talk.
i have
something to do.
 maybe later?
 sure.
take my car and go home.
i'll call you as soon
as i get back. okay?
watch yourself.
don't worry.
 you gonna tell me who it is?
 a cop.
just a fucking cop.
go straight at him.
i'll take the far side.
wherefore my heart is glad
and my spirit rejoices...
my flesh also shall
rest in hope.
thou shalt show me
the path of life.
in thy presence
is the fullness of joy,;
and at thy right hand
there is pleasure for evermore.
in sure and certain hope
of the resurrection and eternal life...
through our lord
jesus christ...
we commend to almighty god
our brother, william dunne...
and we commit his body
to the ground,;
earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
the lord bless him,
keep him.
the lord make his face
to shine upon him...
and be gracious upon him.
 harry!
 waste him!
harry, i didn't know it was you.
that's all right.
 go on and get out of here.
 i'm gonna get the ambulance for you.
it'll come.
now you go on, beat it.
if the cops take you
and i don't make it...
you'll be years
explaining this.
harry, don't die.
 it's not over
 then go on.
go on, get out of here.
beat it.
 i'll see you soon, okay? i'll see you.
 go on!
 what the hell are you doing here?
 saving your ass.
okay. pack whatever
you can't live without.
go to the rock falls airport
and charter a plane.
wait a minute.
where are you going?
to do what an old friend
asked me to do...
knock 'em dead.
did i mention the pit?
yeah, that's the gravel pit.
it's owned by patrovita.
you get an invitation,
don't go.
bustin rocks is only some
of what goes on out there.
we got company.
which way?
i don't see nothin.
i can't get no
satisfaction
i can't get no
satisfaction
'cause i try, and i try
and i try, and i try
i can't get no
i can't get no
when i'm drivin in my car
and a man
comes on the radio
he's telling me
more and more
 about some useless information
 billy, outside! let's go!
supposed to fire
my imagination
i can't get no
no, no, no
hey, hey, hey
that's what i say
i can't get no
satisfaction
i can't get no
satisfaction
'cause i try, and i try
and i try, and i try
i can't get no
i can't get no
when i'm watchin my tv
and a man
comes on and tells me
how white my shirts
can be
but he can't be a man
'cause he doesn't smoke
the same...
what exactly happened here
is unclear
police speculate, based on the amount
of heroin and money found on the scene...
this may be the result
of a brewing mob war
mob war my ass!
brenner!
we don't know where
the son of a bitch is.
let's hope
he's not alive.
from the looks of that mess,
i'd say he was dead.
i think he's right.
don't think, pray!
if he's still alive,
you're not!
oh, shit!
 let's get him before he gets us! the elevators!
 give me an extra clip.
you! stick around.
hold it, hold it,
hold it, hold it!
eh?

 call the fucking cops!
for god's sakes, let it...
kaminski?
this must be what they mean
by poetic justice. 
this is... isn't what you think.
i'm with the government.
i set every one
of these guys up.
so, back with the bureau, huh?
i didn't know that.
it's, uh...
you know, that whole thing
was such a mistake. you and i...
because of you,
a lot of people are dead.
and now it's your turn.
no. no.
resign or be prosecuted.
any way you want it.
excuse me.
we're coming through.
pardon me.
shit!
all right.
careful. careful. watch it.
 okay, lenny.
 they said you got room for one more, right?
 watch your back.
 what do you think baxter was doing here?
until i know different,
i gotta assume our leak's just been plugged.
 pardon the pun.
 what the hell you think happened here?
i think somebody
got very pissed off.
 who?
 i got a good idea.
baker, just got a location on the car
 give it to me.
 a 1979 oldsmobile registered to luigi patrovita...
moving south on route 84.
 should they intercept?
 no. negative.
 tell them to track him. keep
me up on where he is.  tenfour
where are you going?
i'm gonna see
how smart i am.
get on the plane.
you okay?
 you're not going, are you?
 no.
then i'm not either
you're out of excuses,
sweetheart.
there's a quarter million dollars
in that bag.
win or lose,
it's your choice.
now get out of here.
you'll be okay,
won't you?
get going.
i'm glad you didn't
make me chase you.
too damn tired.
that doesn't surprise me. a hundred years
of police work in a single afternoon.
always figured
you were one of us.
how many days in a row...
do i have to haul
your butt down here?
just to watch you
do nothing.
i have no interest...
in becoming
an accomplished cripple.
now you push me back to my room
or out into traffic. i don't give a shit.
things not so good, harry?
 i've seen better days.
 wanna see 'em again?
wont happen from down here.
so, you used to being back
with the bureau?
sure.
and back with my wife.
thank you very much.
come on, mark!
stop fooling around!
give me...
give me my chair
i need your help, harry.
for what?
where's my chair?
my reunion with amy
was a big success.
we just found out
that she's pregnant.
that's great.
that's great.
give me my chair
i don't know anything
about being a father, harry.
i want your help.
i want you to be the godfather
all right. i'll help.
now give me the goddamn chair!
 then walk.
 i can't walk!
then meet me halfway.
come on.
i don't have to walk
to be a godfather!
you don't have to walk,
but you have to try like hell.
 i can't!
 did you ever quit in front of blair?

this is not
a foundry worker's hand.
if you work with steel,
you should be used to the heat.
i want rosta! viktor rosta!
he left!
where?
druzhba cafe!
it's getting harder
ten years ago, no drugs.
now we have a problem.
another 10 years, it'll be like miami.
it'll never happen.
you're wrong.
you know your new nickname?
the officers called you iron jaw...
...but after the fight in the snow,
they call you roundheaded.
actually, i'm circumcised myself.
how's your cold?
awful. did your mother teach you
any home remedies?
try holding a hot rock in your hand.
all right, listen.
you go first and i'll stay behind.
to make sure our men
are positioned properly.
let's get them.
everything's okay.
no problem, officer
let's go. all of you.
why do you always
pick on us georgians?
we are just simple people.
maybe that is why
we are such easy prey.
what's this country coming to?!
this is like the old days!
we are not guilty of anything!
where is your evidence?
i got his brother in the leg.
freeze! you are under arrest!
drop your gun!
now!
handcuffs would be a good idea.
our informants...
...say rosta fled the county
with two other criminals...
...josip baroda
and pytor tatamovich.
we'll find him.
he'll pay far his crimes
against the people.
we're in business.
yes, top priority.
i'm expecting confirmation.
we'll take extreme precaution.
take this to colonel kulikov
immediately.
then send for captain danko.
he is to report as soon as possible.
good news, comrade.
america.
america.
chicago. gangsters.
you are being given
a great responsibility, captain.
viktor has been arrested
for a minor offense.
his two accomplices
are still at large.
viktor was organizing a huge
cocaine shipment from america.
our informants say
bring viktor home.
bring him home.
but don't tell the americans.
i repeat, tell the americans nothing.
do not discuss our problems.
bring viktor to us.
we will avenge yuri...
...and protect ourselves
from the poison of the west.
trust me.
stand up.
i'm taking you home.
eat shit.
what is this key to?
kiss my ass.
comrade captain danko,
this is comrade consul stepanovich.
i am moussorsky,
your liaison officer
we're here from washington.
we took the first flight
when we heard the news.
we need to know what happened.
moscow must get a full report
when we return to washington.
there's nothing to report.
your attitude is disappointing.
he got away.
get the details from the americans.
they ask too many questions.
it could be an embarrassment.
rosta escaped
because of your stupidity.
rosta will finish his deal
and send the american poison home...
...through his georgian network.
we are humiliated before the world.
you've failed.
report whatever you want.
i've already cabled internal affairs.
take the first plane to moscow
when you leave the hospital.
your superiors want to see you...
...the moment you land.
greetings, comrade.
we meet in strange places.

what the hell?
goddamn son of a bitch.
what the hell?
hey, my turn!
me.
come on.
what's wrong with this picture?
nice night for a walk, eh?
nice night for a walk.
washday tomorrow.
nothing clean, right?
nothing clean. right.
i think this guy's a couple cans
short of a six-pack.
your clothes.
give them to me... now.
fuck you, asshole!
hey, sugar, how about it?
i don't have to put up
with that bullshit, man.
she's always after me.
i don't... i don't...
hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?
he the guy?
 hold it right there!
 he's rabbiting.
hey! i said hold it!
go!
that son of a bitch
took my pants!
what day is it? the date!
the 12th of may. thursday.
 what year?
 what?
he's got my gun! let's go!
guard it for me, big buns.
i'm late.
so am i.
 i'm in it.
 so am i.
honey, could i have
that coffee now, please?
yes, sir
who gets the burly beef?
i ordered barbecued beef.
i think that's mine,
but i didn't order fries.
he gets the barbecued beef.
mine's the chili beef deluxe.
who gets the burly beef?
miss, we're ready to order now.
yes, ma'am.
i'm so sorry.
oh, lord.
this isn't real leather, is it?
this special sucks.
nice going, kid.
ought to give you the tip.
look, in a hundred years,
who's going to care?
the 12gauge autoloader
that's italian.
you can go pump or auto.
the.45 long slide,
with laser sighting.
these are brand new.
we just got them in.
that's a good gun.
just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on...
and you put the red dot
where you want the bullet to go.
you can't miss.
anything else?
a phased plasma rifle
in the 40watt range.
just what you see, pal.
the uzi 9mm.
you know your weapons, buddy.
any one of these is ideal
for home defense.
so which will it be?
all.
i may close early today.
there's a fifteen-day wait
on the handguns...
but the rifles
you can take right now.
 you can't do that.
 wrong.
hi, baby. yeah, it's me.
listen, i need you
to come pick me up.
my bike just broke down.
i don't care what you're doing.
come and get me. what the...
hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.
sarah connor?
i'm on my break, chuck.
carla's got my station.
sarah, come here!
it's about you. sort of.
it's so incredible.
you're not gonna believe this.
sit down.
you are going to love this.
 shh!
 what?
...has been compiled
from several witnesses.
once again, sarah connor,
thirty-five, mother of two...
brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.
you're dead, honey.
sorry.
first, i'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one...
and then run my tongue
down your neck...
to your bare, gleaming
breasts...
and then slowly...
slowly pull your jeans off,
inch by inch.
ginger, it's matt!
and lick your belly in circles,
further and further down...
and then pull your panties off
with my teeth.
who is this?
oh, jesus. i'm sorry.
i thought you were...
can i talk to ginger, please?
sure, bunky.
it's the creep.
first, i'm gonna rip the buttons
off your blouse one by one...
you fucking pigs!
wait till i get my hands on you!
 get off of me!
 sit down, fella.
ed.
 what do you got?
 dead girl.
i can see that.
sarah ann connor,
secretary, thirty-five...
shot six times
at less than ten feet.
large caliber weapon.
you know, these work.
what's this?
dead girl two, sent over from
valley division this afternoon.
i'm sure there's a point
to all of this.
look at the name, ed.
sarah louise connor
is this right?
you're kidding me.
the press is going to be
shortstroking it all over
a one-day pattern killer
i hate the weird ones.
so?
better than mortal man deserves.
ginger, have you seen pugsley?
no, not lately.
did you check messages?
i thought you did.
hi, sarah, this is your mom...
there you are, young man.
you mind your mother
hi, sarah. dan moorski.
something's come up.
i can't make it tonight.
just can't get out of it.
look, i'm really sorry.
i'll make it up to you.
call you in a day or so, ok?
sorry. bye.
that bum.
so what if he has a porsche?
he can't treat you like this.
it's friday night,
for christ's sake!
i'll live.
i'll break his kneecaps.
well, pugsley still loves me,
don't you, baby?
god. it's disgusting.
i'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
you and matt have a good time
we will. you, too.
damn it, matt!
oh, shit.
lieutenant, are you aware
that these two killings...
occurred
in the same order..
as their listings
in the phone book?
now, what can i tell you guys?
no comment.
but we've got two murders...
that coffee's two hours cold.
i put a cigarette out in it.
did you reach the next girl yet?
no. i keep getting
an answering machine.
 send a unit.
 i sent a unit.
there's no answer at the door,
and the manager's not home.
 call her
 i just called her
call her again.
give me a cigarette.
hi there.
fooled you.
you're talking to a machine,
but don't be shy, it's ok.
machines need love, too,
so talk to it.
same shit.
i can hear it now.
he's going to be called
the goddamn phone book killer
i hate these press cases.
especially
the weird press cases.
 where you going?
 to make a statement.
maybe make these jackals
work for us for a change.
if i can get on the tube
by eleven o'clock...
maybe she'll call us.
well, how do i look?
like shit, boss.
your mama.
lieutenant!
this just in.
police have announced
the name of the victim...
in the second of
two execution-style murders...
which took place today.
the names of the two victims
are virtually identical.
two hours ago,
was pronounced dead at the scene
in her santa monica apartment...
can we change this?
sarah louise connor was slain...
don't touch it!
...earlier today in her home.
now, police
are refusing to speculate...
on the apparent similarity
between these shooting deaths...
and no other connection
between the two victims...
has been established as of yet.
we'll have more on this story
as it comes in.
a spectacular fire
fueled by solvents, oils...
and other flammable liquids...
swept through an oil company
on north spring street...
just northeast of chinatown
wednesday night.
 hey, you got a phone?
 it's in the back!
hey! four fifty.
this is the los angeles police
department emergency number
emergency number
all our lines are busy.
if you need a police car sent,
please stay on the line.
two-eleven in progress...
corner of third and cameron.
pugsley, shoo! go on.
i'm going to make a belt
out of you.
don't make me bust you up, man!
hi there. fooled you.
hi there. fooled you.
you're talking to a machine,
but don't be shy, it's ok.
machines need love, too,
so talk to it...
and, ginger, that's me,
or sarah will get back to you.
wait for the beep.
ginger, this is sarah!
pick up if you're there!
i'm at this place on
pico boulevard called technoir
i'm really scared.
i think that
there's somebody's after me.
i hope that you play
this back soon.
i need you and matt to come and
pick me up as soon as possible.
the police
keep transferring me around.
i'm gonna give them another try.
the number here is 5559175.
call me, kiddo.
i need your help.
it's her
it's her
sarah connor?
it's lieutenant traxler
lieutenant, don't put me
on hold or transfer me!
i won't. just relax.
where are you?
in this bar called technoir
i know. it's on pico.
are you all right?
yeah, but i don't want to leave.
i think there's a guy
following me.
all right, now listen,
miss connor
now listen carefully.
you're in a public place...
so you'll be safe till
we get there, but stay visible.
don't go outside
or even to the rest room.
i'll have a car there
in a hot minute.
hey, that guy didn't pay.
come with me
if you want to live.
come on!
this is 1119.
i got a hit-and-run felony.
suspect vehicle...
late model gray ford...
headed westbound on seventh.
he's really moving,
punching lights all the way.
i'm going to need
an ambulance...
at seventh and broadway
right now.
hold it!
all units watch
for a late-model gray ford...
last seen westbound
on seventh and broadway.
hold on.
are you injured?
are you shot?
do exactly what i say!
exactly!
don't move unless i say.
don't make a sound unless i say.
do you understand?
 do you understand?
 yes! yes!
please, don't hurt me.
i'm here to help you.
i'm reese, sergeant techcom,
bn38416...
assigned to protect you.
you've been targeted
for termination.
attempt to intercept, 1l19.
this is 1l19.
westbound on olympic
approaching overland.
this is a mistake.
i didn't do anything.
no, but you will.
it's very important
that you live.
this isn't true.
how could that man
just get up after you...
he's not a man... a machine.
a terminator
a cyberdyne systems model 101.
a machine?
like a robot?
not a robot. a cyborg.
a cybernetic organism.
 no. he was bleeding.
 just a second.
get your head down!
all right, listen.
the terminator's
an infiltration unit...
part man, part machine.
underneath, it's a hyper-alloy
combat chassis...
microprocessor controlled,
fully armored... very tough.
but outside,
it's living human tissue...
flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.
 look, i don't know what...
 pay attention!
i got to ditch this car
the 600 series had rubber skin.
we spotted them easy,
but these are new.
they look human...
sweat, bad breath, everything.
very hard to spot.
i had to wait till he moved
on you before i could zero him.
look...
i am not stupid, you know.
they cannot make things
like that yet.
not yet.
not for about forty years.
are you saying
it's from the future?
one possible future.
from your point of view...
i don't know tech stuff.
then you're from the future,
too, is that right?
 right.
 right.
cyborgs don't feel pain.
i do. don't do that again.
 just let me go.
 listen and understand!
that terminator is out there.
it can't be bargained with.
it can't be reasoned with.
it doesn't feel
pity or remorse or fear
and it absolutely
will not stop ever!
until you are dead.
can you stop it?
i don't know.
with these weapons,
i don't know.
all units. gray ford suspect
vehicle has been found...
in a parking structure
at fourth and beaudry.
why me?
why does it want me?
there was a nuclear war..
a few years from now.
all this...
this whole place, everything...
it's gone.
just gone.
there were survivors.
here, there.
nobody even knew who started it.
it was the machines, sarah.
i don't understand.
defense network computers...
new... powerful
hooked into everything.
trusted to run it all.
they say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.
then it saw all people
as a threat...
not just the ones
on the other side.
decided our fate
in a microsecond...
extermination.
did you see this war?
i grew up after it
in the ruins...
starving, hiding from hks.
 hks?
 hunter-killers...
patrol machines
built in automated factories.
most of us were rounded up...
put in camps
for orderly disposal.
this was burned in
by laser scanner
some of us were kept alive...
to work...
loading bodies.
the disposal units
ran night and day.
we were that close
to going out forever
but there was one man
who taught us to fight...
to storm the wire
of the camps...
to smash those
metal motherfuckers into junk.
he turned it around.
he brought us back
from the brink.
his name is connor..
john connor
your son, sarah.
your unborn son.
drive!
 they'll kill you.
 you in the cadillac!
let me see your hands now!
get out of the car!
drop to your knees!
out of the car
drop to the ground.
sarah,
try to drink some of this.
listen, are you sure it's them?
maybe i should look
at the bodies.
no. they've been identified.
there's no doubt.
oh, god.
sarah, this is dr silberman.
hi, sarah.
i want you to tell him
everything reese told you.
do you feel up to that?
i guess so.
you're a doctor?
criminal psychologist.
is reese crazy?
that's what
we're gonna find out.
so, you're a soldier,
fighting for whom?
with the 132nd, under perry.
from 21 to 27.
that's the year 2027?
that's right.
and i was assigned...
this is fucking great.
...the last two years
under john connor
who was the enemy again?
a computer defense system
built for..
damn. sorry.
built for sacnorad
by cyberdyne systems.
i see.
and this computer
thinks it can win...
by killing
the mother of its enemy.
killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived...
a sort of retroactive abortion?
that guy silberman
cracks me up.
last week, he had this guy
in here that burned his afghan.
screwed it first,
then he set it on fire.
shut up.
why didn't the computer
just kill connor then?
why this elaborate scheme
with the terminator?
it had no choice.
their defense grid was smashed.
we'd won.
taking out connor then
would make no difference.
skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.
is that when you
captured the lab complex...
and found that...
what is it called?
the time displacement equipment?
that's right. the terminator
had already gone through.
connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.
how are you supposed get back?
i can't.
nobody goes home.
nobody else comes through.
it's just him... and me.
it's just him... and me.
why didn't you bring
any weapons...
something more advanced?
don't you have ray guns?
ray guns.
show me a piece
of future technology.
you go naked.
something about the field
generated by a living organism.
 nothing dead will go.
 why?
i didn't build
the fucking thing!
ok. but this cyborg,
if it's metal...
surrounded by living tissue!
right.
this is great stuff.
i could make a career
out of this guy.
you see how clever
this part is?
how it doesn't require
a shred of proof?
most paranoid delusions
are intricate...
but this is brilliant.
why were the other
two women killed?
most of the records
were lost in the war
skynet knew almost nothing
about connor's mother
her full name, where she lived.
they just knew the city.
the terminator was
just being systematic.
well, let's go back to...
look, you have heard enough!
i have answered your questions!
now i have to see sarah connor!
i'm afraid that's not up to me.
then why am i talking to you?
because i can help you.
who is in authority here?
shut up!
you still don't get it, do you?
he'll find her
that's what he does!
that's all he does!
you can't stop him!
he'll wade through you,
reach down her throat...
and pull her fucking heart out!
doc.
let go of me...
sorry.
so, reese is crazy?
in technical terminology...
he's a loon.
sarah, this is what
they call body armor
our tac guys wear these.
it'll stop a 12gauge round.
this other individual must have
worn one under his coat.
feel that. go ahead.
what about when he punched
through the windshield?
he was probably on pcp.
broke every bone in his hand
and wouldn't feel it for hours.
there was this guy once...
see this scar?
 here.
 thank you.
there's a couch
in this other room.
why don't you stretch out
and try to get some sleep?
it'll be an hour before your
mother gets here from big bear
 i can't sleep.
 try.
it may not look it, but
that couch is very comfortable.
you'll be perfectly safe.
we got 30 cops in this building.
thank you.
good night.
i'm a friend of sarah connor
i was told that she's here.
could i see her, please?
no. you can't see her
she's making a statement.
where is she?
look, it may take a while.
if you want to wait,
there's a bench over there.
i'll be back.
what the hell was that?
gunshot!
what is it, terrorists?
let's go! let's go!
stay here.
let's get out of here!
come on!
he's got an automatic weapon!
move it, move it!
what the hell
happened to the lights?
watch him.
automatic weapons!
lock and load! let's go!
fire! fire!
this way.
kflb newstime 4:36.
in the top story of the hour..
the largest single
law enforcement mobilization...
in california history
is currently underway.
police in
five southern counties...
are engaged in a massive manhunt
for an unident...
take this.
all right,
let's get this off the road.
 you cold?
 freezing.
you got a first name?
kyle.
kyle...
what's it like
when you go through time?
white light.
pain.
it's like being born maybe.
oh, my god.
i caught one back there.
you mean you got shot?
it's not bad.
we got to get you to a doctor
it's ok. forget it.
what do you mean, forget it?
are you crazy?
take this off.
jesus.
see, it passed
right through the meat.
this is going to make me puke.
would you talk about something?
what?
i don't know.
anything. just talk.
tell me about my son.
he's about my height.
he has your eyes.
what's he like?
you trust him.
he's got a strength.
i'd die for john connor
well... at least now
i know what to name him.
i don't suppose
you know who the father is...
so i won't tell him
to get lost when i meet him.
john never said much about him.
i know he dies before the war..
wait!
i don't want to know.
so, was it john
that sent you here?
i volunteered.
why?
it was a chance
to meet the legend...
sarah connor
taught her son to fight,
organize...
prepare from when he was a kid.
when you were in hiding
before the war..
you're talking about things
i haven't done yet...
in the past tense.
it's driving me crazy.
are you sure
you have the right person?
i'm sure.
come on.
do i look like
the mother of the future?
am i tough, organized?
i can't even
balance my checkbook.
look, reese,
i didn't ask for this honor..
and i don't want it!
any of it!
your son gave me a message
to give to you.
made me memorize it.
thank you, sarah, for your
courage through the dark years.
i can't help you with
what you must soon face...
except to say that
the future is not set.
you must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.
you must survive,
or i will never exist.
that's all.
that's a good field dressing.
you like it?
it's my first.
get some sleep.
it will be light soon.
talk to me some more.
about what?
tell me about where you're from.
all right.
you stay down by day...
but at night
you can move around.
you still have to be careful
because the hks use infrared.
but they're not too bright.
john taught us ways
to dust them.
that's when the infiltrators
started to appear
the terminators
were the newest...
the worst.
traversing your sector
in search mode.
of your position.
understand. 750 meters north.
let's go.
intercept. over
take it easy.
finish your sweep.
they are scavenger teams
in that quadrant.
avoid contact.
repeat, avoid contact.
we'll get them later
roger, echo leader
sector niner,
what's your status?
situation normal.
we're coming in.
roger
firebase,
what's your status? over
reese. bn384.

any infiltrators
at the shopping mall?
no problem.
they were clean.
we're cutting short
the patrol. over
roger, yankee17.
you are clear to return.
terminator!
i was dreaming about dogs.
we use them
to spot terminators.
your world is pretty terrifying.
buddy, you got a dead cat
in there, or what?
fuck you asshole.
god damn!
thank you.
is this enough?
yeah, it's enough.
i don't want to ask
where you got it.
 i'm coming.
 we need a room.
 all right.
 with a kitchen.
do you have one
with a kitchen?
i am dying for a shower
we should check
your bandage, too.
later i'm going out
for supplies.
keep this.
no, i can't tell you
where i am, mom.
i was told not to say.
honey, i need to know
where i can reach you.
you tell me to hide up at
the cabin like some fugitive...
and you won't tell me
what's going on?
i am worried sick, dear
here's the number ready?
here's the number ready?
yes. go ahead.
it's 4085551439.
room nine. got it?
i've got it.
i've got to go.
i'm sorry i can't
tell you more right now.
i love you, mom.
i love you, too, sweetheart.
 tiki motel.
 give me your address.
what have we got?
mothballs.
corn syrup.
ammonia.
what's for dinner?
plastique.
that sounds good.
what is it?
nitroglycerin, basically.
it's a bit more stable.
i learned to make it
when i was a kid.
make sure there's none
on the threads.
like this.
screw the end cap on.
very gently.
you must have had
a fun childhood.
that's good.
all right.
six more like that...
and i'll get started
on the fuses.
he'll find us, won't he?
probably.
it'll never be over, will it?
look at me. i'm shaking.
some legend, huh?
you must be
pretty disappointed.
no. i'm not.
the women in your time...
what are they like?
good fighters.
that's not what i meant.
was there someone special?
someone?
a girl. you know.
never
never?
i'm sorry.
i'm so sorry.
so much pain.
pain can be controlled.
you just disconnect it.
so you feel nothing?
john connor gave me
a picture of you once.
i didn't know why at the time.
it was very old...
torn...
faded.
you were young like you are now.
you seemed just a little sad.
i always wondered what you
were thinking at that moment.
i memorized every line...
every curve.
i came across time
for you, sarah.
i love you.
i always have.
i shouldn't have said that.
think fast!
trade places!
faster! drive faster!
oh, my god!
 whoa!
 son of a bitch!
you stay here.
let's get out of here.
get out.
kyle! come on! get up!
he's coming! kyle!
come on!
help me! get out!
get out!
come on!
faster!
don't stop! run!
we did it, kyle.
we got it.
wait!
what are you doing?
cover.. so he can't track us.
come on!
no, kyle!
come on!
leave me here.
get up!
move it, reese!
on your feet, soldier!
on your feet! move it!
back. go back.
run, sarah.
run!
come on, motherfucker!
you're terminated, fucker!
tape 7, november 10.
where was i?
what's most difficult for me
is trying to decide...
what to tell you
and what not to.
but i guess
i have a while yet...
before you're old enough
to even understand these tapes.
they're more for me
at this point...
just so that
i can get it straight.
fill her up.
should i tell you
about your father?
boy, that's a tough one.
will it affect your decision
to send him here...
knowing that he is your father?
if you don't send kyle,
you can never be.
god, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.
i suppose i will tell you.
i owe him that.
maybe it'll help if...
you know that in the few hours
that we had together..
we loved a lifetime's worth.
what did he just say?
he says
you're very beautiful...
and he's ashamed to ask you...
for five american dollars
for his picture...
but if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.
pretty good hustle, kid.
what did he just say?
he said
there's a storm coming in.
i know.

three billion human lives ended
on august 29, 1997.
the survivors of the nuclear fire...
called the war judgment day. 
they lived only to face
a new nightmare...
the war against the machines.
the computer which controlled
the machines, skynet...
sent two terminators
back through time.
their mission: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.
john connor, my son.
the first terminator was programmed
to strike at me...
in the year 1984...
before john was born.
it failed.
the second was set to strike
at john himself...
when he was still a child.
as before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior..
a protector for john.
it was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.
i need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.
you forgot to say please.
get him off me!
pull it out!
take it.
can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.
now, get off
before i put you down.
that's it, goddamn it.
r31 david, sherman code 6...
at the sixth street bridge and santa fe
on electrical disturbance.
ten-four, r31 david.
john, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.
your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?
i swear, i have had it
with that goddamn kid.
 he won't even answer me anymore.
 honey, move.
would you get off your butt
and help me?
 todd!
 what?
he hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.
oh, it's an emergency.
hang on. i'll get right on it.
come on.
get your ass inside.
do what your mother tells you.
she's not my mother, todd.
this next patient is interesting.
i've been following the case
for years.
a 29-year-old female...
diagnosed as acute
schizoaffective disorder
the usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...
delusions of persecution.
the delusional architecture
is fairly unique.
she believes that a machine
called the terminator..
which looks human,
was sent back through time...
 to kill her
 that's original.
and also that the father
of her child...
was a soldier sent back
to protect her
he was from the future too.
the year 2029,
if i remember correctly.
and here we are.
morning, sarah.
good morning, dr silberman.
how's the knee?
fine, sarah.
she stabbed me in the kneecap...
with my pen a few weeks ago.
repeated escape attempts.
let's move on, shall we?
i don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.
 see she takes her thorazine.
 sure. i'll take care of it.
are you the legal guardian
ofjohn connor?
that's right, officer
what's he done now?
 could i speak with him, please?
 you could if he were here.
he took off on his bike this morning.
he could be anywhere.
do you have a photograph of john?
yeah. hold on.
gonna tell me what this is about?
i just need to ask him
a few questions.
he's a good-looking boy.
do you mind if i keep this picture?
no, go on. there was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.
yeah, a big guy on a bike.
has that got something
to do with this?
i wouldn't worry about him.
thanks for your cooperation.
please insert your stolen card now.
pi n number
hurry up. this is taking too long.
go, baby.
all right.
 pi n number 9003.
 where'd you learn this stuff from?
from my mom.
my real mom, i mean.
withdraw 300 bucks.
come on, baby. come on!
 yes!
 hey, it worked.
all right. easy money.
come on!
yes! piece of cake.
 is that her?
 yes.
she's pretty cool, huh?
no, she's a complete psycho.
that's why she's at pescadero.
it's a mental institute.
she tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.
no shit.
she's a total loser
come on.
let's go spend some money.
it's like a giant strobe light...
burning right through my eyes.
somehow i can still see.
oh, god.
we know the dream's the same
every night.
 why do i have to...
 please continue.
children look like burnt paper
black.
not moving.
and then the blast wave hits them.
and they fly apart like leaves.
dreams...
of cataclysm,
the end of the world...
are very common.
it's not a dream, you moron.
it's real.
 i know the date it happens.
 i'm sure it feels real to you.
on august 29, 1997...
it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin' real to you too!
anybody not wearing two-million sunblock
is gonna have a real bad day. get it?
god, you think
you're safe and alive.
you're already dead. everybody!
him. you. you're dead already.
this whole place,
everything you see is gone!
you're the one living in the dream,
'cause i know it happened!
it happened!
i feel much better now.
clearer
yes, your attitude has been...
much improved lately.
it's helped me to have a goal...
something to look forward to.
what is that?
well, you said...
that if i showed improvement
after six months...
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...
and i could have visitors.
well, it's been six months...
and...
i was looking forward
to seeing my son.
i see.
let's go back to what you were saying
about those terminator machines.
now you think they don't exist?
they don't exist.
i know that now.
but you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...
in a hydraulic press.
if i had, there would have
been some evidence.
they would have found something
at the factory.
i see.
so you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?
no. why would they?
let's try a new position
right there.
mr dyson?
the materials team
is running another..
 mr dyson.
 yes?
the materials team is running
another series this afternoon.
you have to sign for the... it.
 you have to sign it out.
 okay. i'll get it.
i know i haven't been here long,
but i was wondering if you know...
know what?
if you know where it came from.
i asked them the same question once.
you know what they told me?
don't ask.
 good morning, mr dyson.
 how's it going?
insert key.
left on three.
two, one, turn.
 how are the wife and kids?
 great. thanks.
so what do you think, doctor?
haven't i shown improvement?
well, sarah, here's the problem.
i know how smart you are.
you're just telling me
what i want to hear
i don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.
if i put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.
you have to let me see my son.
please.
he's in great danger
he's naked without me.
if i could make a phone call...
i'm afraid not.
not for a while.
i don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...
that you stay here
for another six months.
i'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!
you son of a bitch!
ten ccs of sodium amobarbital, stat!
you don't know what you're doing!
get some restraints in here now!
you don't know what you're doing!
model citizen.
you just missed him.
he was here 15 minutes ago.
 he was going to the galleria.
 yeah.
the galleria?
i'm gonna get some quarters.
i'll be back, all right?
 oh, no!
 girls, do you know john connor?
hey, do you know this guy?
nah, i don't know him.
 john.
 not now.
there's this cop scoping for you.
check it out.
 he's right over there.
 split, man.
 just go.
 yeah.
i saw that kid...
you're not supposed to
be in here!
get down.
mister, are you all right?
you all right?
come on!
goddamn!
okay, timeout.
stop the bike.
time out.
come on, stop the bike.
holy shit.
now, don't take this the wrong way.
 you are a terminator, right?
 yes.
cyberdyne systems, model 101.
holy shit.
you're really real.
i mean...
you're like a machine underneath,
right?
but alive outside?
i'm a cybernetic organism.
living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.
this is intense.
get a grip, john. okay.
you're not here to kill me.
i figured that part out for myself.
so what's the deal?
my mission is to protect you.
yeah? who sent you?
you did.
thirty-five years from now,
you reprogrammed me...
to be your protector here,
in this time.
oh, this is deep.
so this other guy, he's
a terminator like you, right?
not like me.
a t1000, advanced prototype.
more advanced than you are?
yes. a mimetic polyalloy.
what the hell does that mean?
liquid metal.
where are we going?
we have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.
i gotta stop by my house.
i wanna pick up some stuff.
negative. the t1000 would definitely
try to reacquire you there.
 you sure?
 i would.
look, todd and janelle are dicks...
but i gotta warn 'em.
shit. you got a quarter?
 hello.
 janelle, it's me.
 john?
 is everything all right?
 are you guys okay?
 sure, honey, everything's okay.
 are you all right?
 yeah, i'm fine.
john, it's late.
i was beginning to worry about you.
if you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together
i'm making beef stew.
something's wrong.
she's never this nice.
where are you?
what the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?
hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!
the dog's really barking.
you were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.
john, it's late.
please don't make me worry.
could he already be there?
are you okay?
 i'm right here. i'm fine.
 are you sure you're all right?
 what's the dog's name?
 max.
hey, janelle.
what's wrong with wolfie?
i can hear him barking.
is he okay?
wolfie's fine, honey.
wolfie's just fine.
where are you?
your foster parents are dead.
i need a minute here.
you're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?
anything it samples
by physical contact.
get real.
it could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?
no, only an object
of equal size.
why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?
it can't form complex machines.
guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.
it doesn't work that way.
 but it can form solid metal shapes.
 like what?
knives and stabbing weapons.
these were taken by
a video surveillance camera...
at the west highland police station
in 1984.
he killed 17 police officers
that night.
men with families...
children.
these were taken at a mall
in reseda...
today.
miss connor, we know you know
who this guy is.
i just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...
that the foster parents
have been murdered.
we know this guy's involved.
doesn't that mean anything to you?
don't you care?
we're wasting our time.
let's go.
sorry, guys.
she's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.
i'm afraid she can't help us now.
if she clears at all and can
give us anything, i'll call you.
sure.
douglas, take her back to her room.
yes, sir
come on, sweetheart. let's go.
you see...
we spent a lot of time in nicaragua
and places like that.
for a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-green beret guy...
running guns.
then there were some other guys.
she'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader
then she gets busted.
it's like, sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. didn't you know?
like everything i've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.
i hated her for that.
but everything she said was true.
she knew...
and nobody believed her..
not even me.
listen. we gotta get her
out of there.
negative. the t1000's highest
probability for success now...
will be to copy sarah connor and wait
for you to make contact with her
great. what happens to her?
typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.
shit! why didn't you tell me?
we gotta go right now!
negative.
it's not a mission priority.
fuck you!
she's a priority to me!
goddamn it!
what's your problem? help!
this does not help our mission.
get this psycho off of me!
help!
i'm being kidnapped!
get this psycho off of me!
let me go!
why did you do that?
because you told me to.
what?
you have to do what i say?
that's one of my mission parameters.
prove it.
stand on one foot.
yes!
cool. my own terminator wow.
you okay, kid?
take a hike, bozo.
let's get outta here, man.
fuck you, you little dipshit!
dipshit?
put your leg down.
 did you call moi a dipshit?
 just trying to help this punk.
grab this guy.
get him off of me!
now who's the dipshit...
you jock douche bag?
put the gun down now!
 get outta here!
 come on. let's split!
you were gonna kill that guy!
of course. i'm a terminator
listen to me very carefully, okay?
you're not a terminator anymore,
all right?
you got that?
you just can't go around
killing people.
why?
what do you mean, why?
'cause you can't.
because you just can't.
trust me on this.
look. i'm gonna go get my mom.
i order you to help me.
you have a sarah connor here?
you're runnin' kind of late.
they've been in there for an hour
hold on a second.
i'll buzz you in.
oh, here come your friends now.
 gwen, you want some coffee?
 no, thanks.
 how 'bout a beer?
 yeah, right.
 hey, i got a full house.
 that's good, louis.
must be my lucky day.
you're right about number 24.
increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.
 same kind?
 mmhmm.
you!
you broke my arm.
there are 215 bones
in the human body.
that's one. now, don't move.
what are you going to do?
why do we stop now?
you gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
 right.
 swear?
what?
just put up your hand and say,
i swear i won't kill anyone.
i swear i will not kill anyone.
all right. let's go.
visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...
monday through friday.
what the hell are you doing?
you son of a bitch!
you shot me!
crazy bastard!
don't shoot me again.
don't kill me.
he'll live.
son of a bitch!
let's try to remain calm.
open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor
there's no way, connor
let him go.
 open the door
 it ain't gonna happen.
take it easy, sarah.
it won't work. you're no killer
i don't believe you can do it.
you're already dead. everybody dies.
you know i believe it.
so don't fuck with me!
open the door!
back off!
get back!
i'll pump him full of this shit.
i swear!
don't move!
drop the shit!
do it!
get in the office.
on the floor, face down.
not you!
open the door
on the floor hold it open.
face the wall!
get her!
hurry up! open the door!
the door's locked!
let's go! open it!
 she broke it off.
 open it!
let's go around! come on!
move it!
mom, wait!
come back here!
 help her!
 wait here.
 hurry up!
 he'll kill us all!
hold her
he'll kill us all!
mom, are you okay? mom!
come with me
if you want to live.
it's okay, mom.
he's here to help.
go.
what the fuck is it?
what the fuck is going on?
get down.
out of the car!
right now!
go!
i'm out.
 come on.
 here.
reload.
last one!
hang on.
ready!
here, drive.
there's nobody behind us.
 are you all right?
 yeah.
can he see anything?
i see everything.
cool.
come here.
i said i was okay.
john, it was stupid of you
to go there.
you have to be smarter
than that.
you were almost killed.
what were you thinking?
you cannot risk yourself,
even for me.
do you understand?
you're too important.
do you understand?
but...
i had to get you out of that place.
i'm sorry.
i didn't need your help.
what's wrong with your eyes?
nothing.
so, what's your story?
you okay?
fine.
say, that's a nice bike.
watch it, lug nuts.
listen, do you know
what you're doing?
i have detailed files
on human anatomy.
i bet.
makes you a more efficient killer,
right?
correct.
does it hurt
when you get shot?
i sense injuries.
the data could be called pain.
john, help me with the light.
 will these heal up?
 yes.
good. if you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.
how long do you live?
i live in my power cell.
i mean, last. whatever.
a hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.
can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...
so you can be...
you know, more human...
and not such a dork
all the time?
my cpu is a neural net processor,
a learning computer
the more contact i have with humans,
the more i learn.
cool.
are we learning yet?
we have to get as far away
from the city as possible.
just head south.
keep it under 65.
 we don't want to be pulled over
 affirmative.
you gotta listen to the way
people talk.
you don't say affirmative
or some shit like that.
you say, no problemo. 
if someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say,  eat me.
and if you want to shine them on,
it's hasta la vista, baby.
yeah, or  later, dickwad.
if someone gets upset,
you say, chill out.
or you can do combinations.
chill out, dickwad.
that's great.
see? you're getting it.
want some of my fries?
need any help?
no.
 i got you!
 no, you didn't!
we're not gonna make it,
are we?
people, i mean.
it's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.
yeah. major drag, huh?
break it up before i wring
both of your necks.
i need to know
how skynet gets built.
who's responsible?
the man most directly responsible
is miles bennett dyson.
who is that?
he's the director of special projects
at cyberdyne systems corporation.
why him?
in a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor
go on. then what?
in three years cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier..
of military computer systems.
all stealth bombers are upgraded
with cyberdyne computers...
becoming fully unmanned.
afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.
the skynet funding bill is passed.
the system goes online
on august 4, 1997.
human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.
skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.
it becomes self-aware
at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, august 29.
in a panic,
they try to pull the plug.
 skynet fights back.
 yes.
it launches its missiles
against the targets in russia.
why attack russia?
aren't they our friends now?
because skynet knows
that the russian counterattack...
will eliminate its enemies
over here.
jesus.
how much do you know
about dyson?
i have detailed files.
i want to know everything.
what he looks like,
where he lives, everything.
wait in the car
you're pretty jumpy, connor
hey, big john.
what's up?
he's cool, enrique.
he's with me.
he's... uncle bob.
uncle bob, this is enrique.
uncle bob, huh?
okay.
drink?
 uncle bob?
you're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn tv.
pictures of you, john,
your big friend here.
cops are going nuts
looking for you.
i just came for my stuff.
i need clothes, food and a truck.
how about the fillings in my teeth?
now, enrique.
you two,
you're on weapons detail.
let's go.
one thing about my mom...
she always plans ahead.
excellent.
this is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.
you got time to change it out?
yeah. i'm gonna wait 'til dark
to cross the border
i grew up in places like this...
so i thought
that's how people lived...
riding around in helicopters,
learning how to blow shit up.
that's definitely you.
most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.
he taught me engines.
hold here.
mom screwed it up, of course.
she'd always tell 'em
about judgment day...
and me being this world leader
that'd be all she wrote.
torque wrench, please.
here.
i wish i could've met
my real dad.
you will.
yeah, i guess.
when i'm, like, 45, i think.
they sent him back through time
to 1984.
man.
he hasn't even been born yet.
it messes with your head.
 the other bolt.
 oh. here.
mom and him were only together
for one night.
she still loves him, i guess.
i see her crying sometimes.
she denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.
why do you cry?
 you mean people?
 yeah.
i don't know.
we just cry...
you know, when it hurts.
pain causes it?
no. it's different.
it's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.
 you get it?
 no.
all right, my man!
give me five.
just put out your hand
like this.
all right! now hit me.
give me five. do the same thing.
okay, that's good.
up high.
five low.
too slow.
i'm just kidding.
one more time.
good. now try it.
now do me.
give me five.
watching john with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear
the terminator would never stop.
it would never leave him,
never hurt him...
never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...
or be too busy
to spend time with him.
it would always be there...
and it would die
to protect him.
of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...
this thing, this machine...
was the only one
who measured up.
in an insane world...
it was the sanest choice.
hey, let's try this one.
there we go.
she said go south with him
like you planned.
 she'll meet you tomorrow.
 mom!
mom, wait!
 no fate.
no fate but what we make.
my father told her this.
i made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her
never mind.
okay, the whole thing goes...
the future's not set.
there's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.
she intends to change the future.
yeah, i guess.
oh, shit!
 dyson.
 yeah.
gotta be. miles dyson.
she's gonna blow him away.
come on! let's go!
this is tactically dangerous.
drive faster
the t1000 has the same files
that i do.
it knows what i know.
it might anticipate this move.
i don't care.
we gotta stop her
killing dyson
might prevent the war
i don't care!
haven't you learned anything yet?
haven't you figured out
why you can't kill people?
danny, i told you to go to bed.
i'm not kidding.
just a couple of minutes, mom!
danny, your time is up!
come brush your teeth
and get to bed.
danny!
daddy!
danny, go! go!
miles?
 tortsia, run!
 oh, my god!
just take danny and run!
run!
oh, jesus! miles!
daddy!
nobody fucking move!
don't hurt my daddy!
on the floor, bitch.
get down now!
move!
don't hurt him!
get on the floor now!
just let the boy go.
shut up. shut up.
shut up!
it's all your fault, motherfucker
 it's all your fault!
 what?
i'm not gonna let you do it.
shit! we're too late!
check them.
look at me, mom.
are you hurt?
i almost...
it'll be okay.
we'll figure something out.
okay?
i promise.
you came here to stop me.
yeah, i did.
i love you, john.
i always have.
i know.
deep penetration.
no shattered bone.
hold here.
the pressure should stop the bleeding.
who are you people?
show him.
danny, i want you to come with me
right now. show me your room.
oh, my god.
now listen to me
very carefully.
dyson listened while the terminator
laid it all down.
skynet. judgment day.
the history of things to come.
it's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...
for three billion deaths.
he took it pretty well.
i feel like i'm gonna throw up.
you're judging me...
on things i haven't even done yet.
how were we supposed to know?
yeah.
right.
how were you supposed to know?
fucking men like you...
built the hydrogen bomb.
men like you...
thought it up.
you think you're so creative.
you don't know what it's like
to really create something...
to create a life...
to feel it growing inside you.
all you know how to create
is death and destruction.
mom!
we need to be a little more
constructive here. okay?
we still have to stop this
from happening.
but i thought...
aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?
that's right. there's no way i'm going
to finish the new processor not now.
forget it. i'm out of it.
i'll quit cyberdyne tomorrow.
that's not good enough.
no one must follow your work.
right.
all right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab...
the files, the disk drives...
everything here.
everything.
i don't care.
the chip.
 do you know about the chip?
 what chip?
it's at cyberdyne.
it's from the other one like you.
the cpu from the first terminator
son of a bitch!
i knew it!
they told us not to ask
where they got it.
those lying motherfuckers.
it's scary stuff.
radically advanced.
it was smashed.
it didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.
things we would've never..
all my work was based on it.
it must be destroyed.
can you get us in?
past security?
i think so, yeah. when?
now?
the future,
always so clear to me...
had become like
a black highway at night.
we were in
uncharted territory now...
making up history
as we went along.
carl, right?
friends from out of town.
i just thought i'd...
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.
mr dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.
i need written authorization...
i insist.
don't even think about it.
it's okay.
it takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.
the other one is in a locker
at the security station.
gibbons?
gibbons! come on, man!
you can't leave the desk
like that!
oh, shit.
my card should access this.
 what is it?
 damn it.
the silent alarm's been tripped.
it's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.
nothing will open anywhere now.
we have to abort.
we go all the way.
okay?
you guys get started on the lab.
i can open this.
 i think it's that guy from the mall.
 it is.
it's him and the woman.
just send everything
you got in the area right now.
i have a personal entry code
for the lab. it may still work.
it's no good.
let me try mine.
john, fire in the hole!
wait! you can't go in there.
the fire set off the halon system.
you have to wait
until the gas clears.
put this on.
all right, let's get to work.
all units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...
a 211 in progress, 2144 kramer street,
the cyberdyne building.
suspect one is white female...
identified as last name connor,
first name sarah.
escaped last night
from pescadero state hospital.
suspect two: white male fitting
description of the individual...
wanted for the murder
of police officers in 1984.
suspects are armed
and considered extremely...
all right.
easy money.
uhoh.
oh, shit. not good.
how we doing?
primer cord is set.
one more barrel,
two more minutes.
 how do we set them off?
 remote control.
piece of cake.
 we got company.
 police?
 how many?
 all of' em, i think.
go. i'll finish here.
come on.
i'll take care of the police.
wait! you swore!
trust me.
you at the window!
drop your weapon and place your hands
on top of your head!
holy shit!
that's a minigun!
 come on!
 oh, shit!
go! go! go!
fire!
same time, to the left.
one, two, three, go.
in order to get that out...
we got skynet by the balls now.
come on, let's book.
hold your fire!
 ready to rock?
 ready.
time to go.
now.
 take this. they'll use gas.
 come on.
get started on the door
miles, hand me the detonator
mom! mom!
shit!
she's in the clean room.
there's no way outta there.
get down!
here.
i don't know how much longer
i can hold this.
fall back!
everybody out!
fall back now!
go! go! go!
we got a war zone here!
shut your eyes.
stay here. i'll be back.
get down on the floor!
face down!
on the floor now!
okay, drop him!
here, hold this.
holy shit!
go!
shit!
get out.
listen.
no matter what happens,
stay under these vests.
 you got it?
 yeah.
all right.
chopper's coming in!
it's him.
shit!
stay down!
goddamn!
you okay...
come on, mom,
we gotta get out.
take the shotgun.
are you hurt?
holy shit.
come on, mom. come on!
we need your truck.
hurry!
 come on. hurry.
 get in.
go!
what the hell...
 i'm bleeding bad.
 keep pressure on it.
here. this'll work.
he's gaining.
step on it!
 this is the vehicle's top speed.
 i can run faster than this!
coming up, to the right.
watch it! watch it!
 drive.
 where are you going?
take the offramp.
shit!
hold on!
don't stop!
go straight!
look out!
duck!
get the hell outta here!
get outta here!
let's go! come on!
hasta la vista, baby.
we don't have much time.
let's go.
we gotta get outta here.
come on! get up!
hand me the shotgun.
put your weight on me, mom.
hurry!
come on, mom.
get up!
this way. come on.
wait! no. no. it's too hot.
go back.
 go. run.
 no! we gotta stick together
john, you've got to go now.
 john!
 go! now!
get up the steps.
go.
get up.
come on, mom.
i got you.
grab the chain. grab it.
grab it. go. go!
mom, come on! mom!
call to john.
i know this hurts.
call john.
call to john now.
fuck you.
help!
mom.
help me.
get out of the way, john.
shoot!
get down!
get up. come on.
holy shit.
i need a vacation.
is it dead?
terminated.
will this melt in there?
yes. throw it in.
and the chip.
it's over
there's one more chip.
and it must be destroyed also.
here.
i cannot self-terminate.
you must lower me into the steel.
i'm sorry, john. i'm sorry.
no, it'll be okay.
stay with us.
 it'll be okay.
 i have to go away.
no, don't do it.
please, don't go.
i must go away, john.
no, wait.
you don't have to do this.
i'm sorry.
no, don't do it! don't go!
it has to end here.
i order you not to go!
i know now why you cry.
but it's something
i can never do.
goodbye.
the unknown future
rolls toward us.
i face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.
because if a machine,
a terminator..
can learn the value
of human life...
maybe we can too.

the future has not been written.
there is no fate but what
we make for ourselves.
i wish i could believe that.
my name is john connor
they tried to murder me before i was born.
when i was 13, they tried again.
machines from the future.
terminators.
all my life, my mother told me
the storm was coming.
judgment day.
connor!
the beginning of a war
between man and machines.
three billion lives
would vanish in an instant.
and i would lead what was left
of the human race to ultimate victory.
it hasn't happened.
no bombs fell.
computers didn't take control.
we stopped judgment day.
i should feel safe...
...but i don't.
so i live off the grid.
no phone, no address.
no one and nothing can find me.
i've erased all connections to the past.
but as hard as i try...
...i can't erase my dreams...
...my nightmares.
i feel the weight of the future
bearing down on me.
a future i don't want.
so i keep running...
...as fast as i can.
anywhere.
nowhere.
oh, my god.
are you okay?
do you want me to call 911?
i like this car
what are you?
you, in the silver lexus. slow down.
slow down and pull over immediately.
lady, have you any idea
how fast you were going?
let me see your license and registration.
i like your gun.
what?
this stupid thing's not working.
what's wrong with this thing?
i hate machines.
hello?
kate, it's your father
you're blowing me off again.
i'm so sorry. you know how much
i wanted to see you this weekend.
but we're having computer problems
i know, you can't talk about it.
it's just...
...scott was really looking forward to this.
katie. i wish i had more time
to get to know him. i really do.
that's okay. you're bound
to run into him at the wedding.
please. i'm still
in a state of denial about that.
you're not the only one.
hey, kiddo.
you don't need me
to pass judgment on this guy.
you've done the right thing
your whole life.
you won't make a mistake. you never do.
i'm the luckiest father
in the world, you know?
i've never had to be afraid
for my daughter
listen, i hate this. i gotta run.
come see me. i promise i won't cancel.
we will.
bye, dad, i love you.
love you too.
okay, what have we got?
this new computer virus is tricky.
it's infected half the civilian internet
as well as secondary military apps.
payroll, inventory.
primary defense nets are still clean?
so far the firewalls are holding up.
sir, the pentagon has proposed we use
our al to scan the infrastructure.
search and destroy
for any hint of the virus.
i know, tony, but that's like
going after a fly with a bazooka.
once the connection's made,
it should only be a few minutes.
during which we've put everything under
the control of a single computer system.
the most intelligent system
ever conceived.
i still prefer to keep humans in the loop.
i'm not sure skynet's ready.
yes, sir
thanks.
you're supposed to go around
to the back.
hey, i said you're supposed to go
take off your clothes.
patience, honey.
bitch. wait your turn.
your clothes.
talk to the hand.
now.
welcome to jim's burgers.
can i take your order?
jose barrera?
yeah, that's me.
growing concern over widespread outages
in the global digital network...
...have prompted rumors
of a new computer super-virus.
wall street analysts are confident...
shit! my mom's home.
here. hide the beer hide the beer
here. take that.
go, go, go.
elizabeth and william anderson?
i'm bill. my sister's upstairs.
is there something wrong?
what's going on?
i have to go to the clinic.
it's an emergency.
it's 4:30 in the morning.
well, i'll be back before you get up.
cool it, guys, it's just me.
we've got a sick cat coming in.
great.
junkies.
please, don't do that.
i suppose it was you who
ripped us off last week.
put the phone down.
sorry.
i just...
i needed some medicine.
there's an emergency clinic
half a mile away.
can't do that.
how much did you take?
enough.
well...
...this is the stuff we use
to chemically neuter dogs.
take a look.
hey!
jesus! you didn't have to do that!
next time bring a clue,
not a paintball gun.
no, this isn't what you think.
yeah, right.
it's hercules. i think he's got pneumonia.
he started coughing and wouldn't stop.
betsy, i've got a problem in the back.
a problem? this is an emergency!
it sounds like a hairball.
i know what a hairball sounds like.
where's dr monroe?
it's 5:30 in the morning.
i'm sure he's home sleeping.
he'll come in if he has to.
just wait in here with hercules
and i'll be a few minutes, all right?
mike kripke's basement.
what? what does that mean?
you're john connor
i'm kate brewster
we went to
west hills junior high together
jesus.
what happened to you, john?
middle of eighth grade,
you just disappeared.
and there was that thing
about your foster parents.
yeah, they were murdered.
i didn't do it.
what the hell?
is somebody with you?
katherine brewster?
no.
john connor was here.
where did he go?
tell me. where did he go?
katherine brewster?
what are you doing? let me down!
let me down! let me down!
where is john connor?
if i tell you, will you let me go?
yes.
he's...
...in the kennel, in a cage.
you said that you'd let me go.
i lied.
please, please, please.
you have to let me go!
john connor
it is time.
you here to kill me?
no. you must live.
why are you here? where are we going?
keep moving.
get out of here.
now!
no pulse.
see if you can get him down.
i can't.
this guy weighs a ton.
911.
yes. yes. i'm being kidnapped.
where are you now?
i don't know where. i'm in my truck.
it's a toyota tundra.
it says emery animal hospital
on the side. i'm locked inside the back.
hello?
hello?
shit! shit!
get off.
let me out!
what are you doing here?
you tell me. you got me into this.
stop the car
i can't. not yet.
you bastard! stop the car!
shut up!
son of a bitch.
goddamn it.
look what you did to my car
this is my company car, asshole.
get your ass out here.
get your ass out of the car now!
what are you doing?
if you don't have insurance,
i'm gonna rip your balls off.
i don't want any problems, okay?
shut up!
help!
who's talking back there?
what's going on?
calm down.
shut up!
i'm being kidnapped! call the police!
well, i'll be goddamned.
call 911!
a cop when you need one.
help, please! please!
let me out of here! help!
get back here, asshole!
that's the cops!
you have to pull over!
yeah, first chance i get.
hold on!
stop it!
i'll drive.
get out.
excuse me.
move over
no sign of brain trauma.
yeah, i'm fine, thanks.
do you even remember me?
sarah connor? blowing up cyberdyne?
hasta la vista, baby. 
ring any bells?
that was a different t101.
what, do you come off an assembly line
or something?
exactly.
oh, man. i'm gonna have
to teach you everything all over again.
katherine brewster,
have you sustained injury?
drop dead, you asshole!
i'm unable to comply.
where are you taking me?
to a safe location.
all right, get off at the next exit.
let her out.
negative.
katherine brewster must be protected.
i thought i was the one they were after
you could not be located.
so a tx was sent back through time
to eliminate your lieutenants.
so she's gonna be in the resistance?
no, no.
no, you shouldn't even exist.
i mean,
we took out cyberdyne over 10 years ago.
we stopped judgment day.
you only postponed it.
judgment day is inevitable.
i require a cutting tool.
here, take the wheel.
what are you doing?
i am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.
my primary cell was damaged
by a plasma attack.
tx is designed for extreme combat,
driven by a plasma reactor..
...and equipped with onboard weapons.
its arsenal includes...
...nanotechnological transjectors.
meaning?
it can control other machines.
its body chassis is heavily armored
and hardened to withstand external attack.
you'll find a way to destroy her
unlikely.
i'm an obsolete design.
tx is faster, more powerful
and more intelligent.
it's a far more effective
killing machine.
oh, great.
that's great.
my presence in this timeline
has been anticipated.
tx is designed to terminate
other cybernetic organisms.
so she's an anti-terminator
terminator?
you've gotta be shitting me.
no, i am not shitting you.
when ruptured,
the fuel cells become unstable.
relax.
let me out of here!
relax!
man, this is whack.
it's been like this for hours.
every goddamn station.
hey.
hey! are you gonna pay for that?
talk to the hand.
help! help me!
help!
i think we better go.
jerky?
you're kidnapping me.
look
god, you were always a delinquent.
and look at you now, sitting there
like the bad boy thing still works.
what are you,
some kind of gang member?
how do you live with yourself?
what?
tell her who i am.
john connor is leader of the worldwide
resistance and last hope of humankind.
right. and him?
he's a robot from the future.
living tissue over a metal skeleton,
sent back in time to protect me.
go to hell.
he doesn't mean you any harm.
i have a fiance.
he's gonna be looking for me.
what is it that you want?
just...
...imagine...
...if you knew you were gonna do
something important with your life.
something amazing.
maybe the most important thing
anyone has ever done.
but there's a catch.
something terrible has to happen.
you couldn't...
...live with yourself if you didn't try
to stop it, but...
what are you talking about?
it's just the life you know...
...all the stuff that
you take for granted...
...it's not gonna last.
mike kripke.
back there, why did you say
kripke's basement?
because mike kripke's house...
...that's where the kids used
to go make out, right?
so you and me
wait, did we...?
holy shit, we did.
we made out in kripke's basement.
i cannot believe you remembered that.
i must have made
some kind of impression.
give me a break.
i only remembered because
the next day you were in the news.
wait a second. you and me hooked up
the day before i first met him.
and now again, 10 years later
we were supposed to meet.
coincidence.
yeah.
hon? did you just get in?
hi, i'm detective edwards, l.a.p.d.
this is detective bell.
we're looking for katherine brewster
is she here?
no.
you're her fiance, scott mason?
yes.
there was an incident at the
veterinary hospital where she works.
we're concerned something
may have happened to her
where is she?
we got a report from a gas station
attendant near victorville...
...about a possible kidnapping
and it might be related.
i'll help you find her
come with me.
go.
your mother?
i never even knew
where she was buried.
i hit the road the day she died.
why did you bring me here?
no! what are you doing?
hey, stop!
get away from it! stop!
sarah connor was cremated in mexico.
her friends scattered her ashes
in the sea.
they stored these weapons
in accordance with her will.
what happened to her?
leukemia.
i'm sorry.
we were living in baja
when she was diagnosed.
they only gave her six months.
but she fought for three years.
long enough to make sure.
to make sure?
that the world didn't end.
every day after this one is a gift. 
she told me, we made it. we're free. 
but i never really believed that.
i guess she didn't either
you know you were about
the closest thing to a father i ever had?
how pathetic is that?
out of my way!
my mission is to protect you.
that's enough.
move or i'll do it!
i swear i will! i'll shoot you!
go ahead. see what happens.
don't do that.
oh, my god.
this is the police.
we have the building surrounded.
release your hostage!
just leave me here. i'm not the one
you want. you're wasting your time.
incorrect. john connor
leads the resistance to victory.
how?
why? why me?
you are john connor
christ, my mom fed me that bullshit
since the cradle.
look at me.
i'm no leader, i never was!
i'm never gonna
let go.
you're right.
you're not the one i want.
i'm wasting my time.
fuck you, you fucking machine!
better
oh, you were just dicking with me?
anger is more useful than despair
what?
basic psychology is among
my subroutines.
perps still holed up?
gotcha.
good news. your fianc's okay.
where is she?
green lawn cemetery,
up off the 5 freeway.
it's right by the desert.
but they're gonna bring her back to the
oh, my god! oh, my dear jesus! god!
you're safe now. they can't hurt you.
kate, my name is dr silberman.
i'm a posttrauma counselor
for the sheriff's department.
how are you feeling?
he's not human.
he's really not human.
i know what it's like to be
in a hostage situation.
i've been there myself.
the fear, the adrenaline.
you find yourself imagining things.
impossible things.
crazy things.
insane things.
take years to get over it.
go, go, go!
move it!
drop your weapon!
and the coffin!
take him down! take him down!
resume fire!
we must reacquire katherine brewster
why? what makes her
so goddamn important?
through her, you contact remnants of the
military and learn how to fight skynet...
...forming the core
of the resistance.
later,
your children will become important.
what?
she's your wife.
get in!
do you want to live? come on!
it was scott! how could it be scott?
your fiance?
the tx is polymimetic,
able to take the form of anything it touches.
your fianc is dead.
oh, my god!
do something!
get down.
we need a new vehicle.
hey, come on.
we gotta keep moving.
she killed scott because of me.
look, i know this won't help...
...but sometimes things happen
that we just can't change.
it's not your fault.
are you sure about this?
about her and me, i mean.
your confusion is not rational.
she's a healthy female of breeding age.
there's more to it than that.
my database does not encompass
the dynamics of human pair bonding.
so this terminatrix, how many others
does she have on her hit list?
twenty-two. anderson, elizabeth.
anderson, william.
barrera, jose. brewster, robert.
my father?
having failed to acquire its primary target,
tx will resume its default program.
she's gonna kill my father too?
there's a high probability.
no.
who is he? what does he do?
he's in the air force. weapon design,
secret stuff. i don't know, exactly.
general robert brewster
is program director of crs...
...cyber research systems,
autonomous weapons division.
skynet. you're talking about skynet.
skynet is one of the digital defense systems
developed under brewster
oh, god.
oh, my god. of course.
it all makes sense now.
if you hadn't come back when i was a kid,
changed everything...
...she and i would have gotten together
then. i would have met her father
don't you see?
i don't understand.
your father
this is all about your father
he's the key. he always was. your father
is the one who can shut skynet down.
he's the only one who ever could.
we have to get to him
before the tx does.
negative. i cannot jeopardize my mission.
this is your mission, to save people!
my mission is to ensure the survival
of john connor and katherine brewster
i am giving you an order
i am not programmed
to follow your orders.
after the nuclear war, you both
nuclear war?!
there doesn't have to be a war!
we can stop it!
there is insufficient time.
the first launch sequences
will be initiated at 6:18 p. m.
what, today?
affirmative.
john, what is he saying?
judgment day.
the end of the world.
it's today, three hours from now.
two hours and 53 minutes.
we must continue south into mexico
to escape the primary blast zones.
no, we have to get to her dad.
the mojave area will sustain
significant nuclear fallout.
you will not survive.
you mean we go run and hide somewhere
in a hole while the bombs fall?
it is your destiny.
fuck my destiny.
john.
you cannot self-terminate.
no, you can't.
i can do whatever i want.
i'm a human being.
i'm not some goddamn robot.
cybernetic organism.
whatever!
either we get her father
to shut skynet down...
...stop this shit from ever happening,
or so much for the great john connor
because your future, my destiny,
i don't want any part of it. i never did.
based on your pupil dilation,
skin temperature and motor functions...
...i calculate an 83% probability
that you will not pull the trigger
please do what he says.
you have to save my father!
we can reach crs
in approximately one hour..
...depending on traffic conditions.
i can't get a line.
the whole cell network is down.
skynet is assuming control
over global communications...
...in preparation for its attack.
so if this war is between people
and machines...
...why are you on our side?
the resistance captured me
and reprogrammed my cpu.
i was originally designed
for assassination missions.
so...
...you don't really care
if this mission succeeds or not.
if we get killed,
does that mean anything to you?
if you were to die,
i will become useless.
there will be no reason for me to exist.
thank you for doing this.
your gratitude is not required.
i am programmed
to follow your commands.
her commands?
katherine brewster had me reactivated and
sent through the time displacement field.
what exactly am i in this
future of yours?
you're john connor's spouse
and second-in-command.
no, i
what?
you're a mess.
hey, you're not exactly my type, either
why didn't i send you back?
i am not authorized
to answer your question.
why didn't he send you back?
he was dead.
well, that sucks.
humans inevitably die.
yeah, i know.
so how does it? no.
maybe i don't want to know.
how does he die?
john connor was terminated
on july 4th, 2032.
i was selected for the emotional attachment
he had for my model number..
...due to his boyhood experiences.
this aided in my infiltration.
what are you saying?
i killed you.
this has to be a mistake. as of 1100 hours,
all primary military systems were secure.
they were. only the civilian sector
was affected. internet, air traffic.
minutes ago, guidance computers
at vandenberg crashed.
we thought it was an error
it looks like the virus.
early warning in alaska is down.
satellite signals are scrambled.
what about the missile silos, the subs?
we've lost contact.
you're saying this country
is completely open to attack.
theoretically, we could be
under attack already.
who's doing this? a foreign power
or some computer hacker in his garage?
we can't trace the virus
or pin it down.
it keeps growing and changing,
like it has a mind of its own.
this can't be happening.
the pentagon's on the secure line.
it's the chairman.
all right.
look...
...none of this is gonna happen.
we get to your dad, get him to pull the plug
on skynet. the bombs won't fall.
he won't have to kill me someday.
he'll never even exist.
you and i, we can
just go our separate ways.
you know, mike kripke's basement...
that was the first time
i ever kissed a guy.
really?
your levity is good.
it relieves tension and the fear of death.
we're hoping you have a solution for us.
i know, sir, but skynet is not ready
for a systemwide connection.
that's not what your civilian
counterparts there told me.
they say we can stop this damn virus.
i understand there's a certain amount
of performance anxiety...
...but your boys say if we plug skynet
into all of our systems...
...it'll squash this thing and give me back
control of my military.
mr chairman, i need
to make myself very clear
if we uplink now, skynet will be
in control of your military.
but you'll be in control of skynet, right?
that is correct, sir
then do it.
and brewster, if this thing works...
...you'll get all the funding
you'll ever need.
yes, sir
sir?
shall i?
no.
it's my job now.
skynet defense system activated.
we're in.
we're past the firewalls, local
defense nets, minutemen, subs.
skynet's fully operational,
processing at 60 teraflops a second.
it should take less than a minute
to find the virus and kill it.
let's pray to god this works.
power failure?
no. i don't know what it is.
what the hell is going on?
daddy!
what are you doing here?
daddy! get away from it!
watch out!
daddy, don't move.
she'll be back.
we have to shut down skynet.
where's the system core?
in this building?
skynet. the virus has infected skynet.
skynet is the virus!
it's why everything's falling apart!
skynet has become self-aware.
in one hour it will initiate
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.
what enemy?
us!
humans.
oh, god! it's the machines.
they're starting to take over
my office, on this floor,
we have to get there.
the access codes are in my safe.
why are they killing everyone?
to destroy any possible threat to skynet.
which ones are the codes?
red envelope.
crystal peak. you have
to get to crystal peak.
what is he saying?
crystal peak.
a hardened facility
in the sierra nevada mountains.
fifty-two miles northeast,
bearing 0.5 degrees.
that's the system core?
it's your only chance.
you'll need a plane. the particle accelerator
leads to the runway.
take care of my daughter
oh, katie, i am sorry.
i opened pandora's box.
get down!
no...
no.
there's nothing you can do. come on.
we must go. it is not safe here.
kate, we have to go.
kate! he wanted you to come with me.
he wanted us to shut skynet down.
come on.
come on.
run!
let's go.
that's it. we can follow it
out to the runway.
come on.
what?
nothing.
you remind me of my mother
oh, god. she's coming.
what are you doing?
powering up.
come on.
it's working.
just die, you bitch!
come on.
there's my father's plane.
i trained on it.
yes! he made it.
get away from me.
leave!
now!
let's go!
the master's on. throttle's set.
come on. let's go.
oh, please. you can't do this.
i have no choice.
the tx...
...has corrupted my system.
you can't kill a human being.
you said so yourself.
let him go!
you're fighting it right now.
my cpu is intact.
but i cannot control my other functions.
you don't have to do this.
you don't want to do this!
desire is irrelevant.
i am a machine.
what is your mission?
to ensure the survival of john connor..
...and katherine brewster
you are about to fail that mission!
i can i cannot.
you know what you have to do.
you know my destiny.
i have to live.
are you okay?
what happened?
he couldn't do it.
he shut himself down.
can you fly?
yeah.
okay. 015 degrees...
...52 miles, our max air speed
is about 160.
we've got 32 minutes.
it's just you and me now.
what if we can't stop it?
there's enough c4 here
to take out 10 supercomputers.
we're gonna make it, kate.
the future is up to us.
that's gotta be it.
skynet. there may be more of them.
come on.
i think this is some kind of blast door
there's no way
we can blow through this thing.
john, look.
now what?
it's a code prompt.
type in dakota 775.
red 176.
come on!
we gotta get this thing open.
here. it's avalon 412.
put it in!
come on!
i'm back.
go! now!
come on!
thank you.
we'll meet again.
go!
come on!
you are terminated!
the elevator
i'll set the detonator for five minutes.
that should give us enough time
to make it back up.
what is this place?
these computers are 30 years old.
this isn't skynet.
there's nothing here.
this is a fallout shelter for vips.
only they never got the warning.
goddamn it!
there's nothing here!
why didn't he tell us?
why did he lead us down here?
to live.
that was his mission.
there was never any stopping it.
john...
...we could just...
...let it go.
hello?
hello? can somebody hear me?
this is montana civil defense.
somebody please come in.
is there anybody there?
anyone reading me? over
rumors about a launch sequence.
command and control have broken down.
is anyone receiving me?
somebody?
somebody please come in.
anybody out there?
this is sac nellis. we're under attack.
cq? cq?
is anybody there?
this is john connor at crystal peak.
connor? what the hell is happening?
who's in charge there?
i am.
connor, can you help us?
this is montana civil defense.
where did you say you were again?
by the time skynet
became selfaware...
...it had spread into millions
of computer servers across the planet.
ordinary computers in office buildings,
dorm rooms, everywhere.
it was software in cyberspace.
there was no system core.
it could not be shut down.
the attack began at 6:18 p. m.,
just as he said it would.
judgment day.
the day the human race
was nearly destroyed...
...by weapons they'd built
to protect themselves.
i should have realized our destiny
was never to stop judgment day.
it was merely to survive it...
...together
the terminator knew.
he tried to tell us...
...but i didn't want to hear it.
maybe the future has been written.
i don't know.
all i know is what
the terminator taught me:
never stop fighting.
and i never will.
the battle has just begun.

yankee nine-niner, what are your coordinates?
above release point echo bravo one.

he said detain him. don't drop him.
richards, you're gonna fry for this.
and i'll see you in hell.
come on. keep digging.
what's the holdup?
this one's had it.

 don't listen to it.  i worry about the kids.
the network shuts down the schools.
the kids are either in hiding or getting basic training.
brainwashed by the tv.
we can jam the network once we find the uplink to the satellite.
 then we'll broadcast the truth.  the truth?
hasn't been popular lately.
can't find the code or the uplink.
i don't know where the network hid something that big.
but they managed.
stevie, would you mind?
goodbye, my lovely.
you're one of the cops who locked up all my friends.
burned my songs.
people like you took this country and turned it into a jail.
 we don't want his death on our hands.  he's a cop.
 he's the butcher of bakersfield.  come on, mic.
you can see through that crap. it's network propaganda.
we don't know that.
we know we wouldn't be here if he hadn't helped us.
 we also know he's not one of us.  perhaps now he's seen too much.
i've seen too much? all i've seen is a bunch of low foreheads...
who think they can change the world with dreams and talk.
it's too late for that.
if you're not ready to act, give me a break and shut up.
nothing worth losing your head over, though, huh?
you got it.
hey, get out of here!
well, there's your ride. it's all set.
nothing like first class.
come in. seorita, do you want to come in?
yeah. hey, you too!
i guess this is it.
now you, weiss, stay out of the national database, okay?
and you, laughlin, stop trying to teach the constitution to the street punks.
 see you at the 10year reunion.  you can still join us.
no, thank you. my brother's gonna get me out of the city.
i'm not into politics. i'm into survival.
nowadays, it's the same thing.
save it for the written test. good luck.
yeah, for all of us.
we need you, damon!
brenda, do you have this week's ratings, or do i have to guess?
they're the same as last week, and those were the same last month.
i guess we've just peaked. but it's not like we've dropped.
not like we... you're beautiful, sweetheart.
 sorry, mr killian!  that's all right. what's your name?
 dan.  dan, you're doing good work.
 don't worry. okay?  thank you. thank you.
brenda, if that asshole is mopping the floor tomorrow...
you'll be mopping it for the rest of the week.
let's go!
security code accepted.
damon, were you down in wardrobe yet? your new jackets are fantastic.
who chose the colors? hey, how are my people today?
 fine, sir thank you.  you're looking good.
tony, what do you got for me?
damon, thank god! the justice department's calling every 10 minutes.
just give them an evasive answer tell them to go fuck themselves.
got my coffee?
 i want to know what we got, all right?  all right. let's see.
lights.
oh, god. kitchen, toast and coffee.

then you're ready for captain freedom's workout.
yes, it's america's own captain freedom.
ten-time national champion. the greatest stalker to ever play the game.
all right now, all you runners. ready, get set, go!
we interrupt captain freedom's workout to bring you this urgent news bulletin.
the city police are engaged in a door-to-door search...
for benjamin a. richards, known as the butcher of bakersfield.
richards, a former police officer, was the helicopter pilot...
who went berserk 18 months ago, firing without warning...
on a crowd of innocent civilians.
if you see this man, do not approach him.
contact your local block warden. he is considered armed and dangerous.
don't make a sound. understand? who are you? a friend of my brother's?
 what are you talking about?  this is his apartment.
i moved in last month. they told me the last tenant was taken away for..
 yes?  for reeducation.
help!
assasino in my house! el butcher of bakersfield's in my bathroom!
that's the ticket. no pain, no gain.
let go of me! let me go!
now, listen to me. i'll only say this once.
this is all a lie. i was framed. i'm completely innocent.
 yeah, sure.  now be quiet and stay still...
and i'm out in five minutes.
hi, this is amber i'm not home right now.
i'm out having a wonderful time with glamorous people in a fabulous place.
so, when you hear the tone, control your jealousy and leave your message.
 baby facemarch.  are you kidding me? next!
how's this one? case 114. schoolteacher
killed his wife and mother-in-law at a faculty dinner party with a steak knife.
yeah. see, i like that quality.
he's the sort that the neighbors say, such a quiet man.
never too busy to say hello. but look at him.
he weighs 120 pounds. he wouldn't last 30 seconds.
who else?
what about those bank robbers? the ones that made that suicide pact.
 did they commit suicide?  obviously not, damon.
then they're unreliable.
i got a friend at a talent agency. maybe they've got an axe murderer
hello, gorgeous.
 somebody with stamina.  tony!
pipe that feed in here now.
take a look at this. this is yesterday's prison break.
look.
look at that mother move.
 is he beautiful? who is he?  are you kidding? that's ben richards.
the cop from the massacre?
sensational! perfect contestant. i want him.
 can't have him.  why not?
you know our contract. we never get military prisoners.
who's a military prisoner? he's still at large.
yeah? well, they'll get him for me.
cadres can't have it both ways.
they want ratings? i can get 10 points for his biceps alone.
hello, this is killian.
get me the justice department, entertainment division.
no, hold that. operator?
get me the president's agent.
what is this?
that's my synthesizer setup.
i'm a musician.
well, i'm really a singer
i write music for the network. have you heard their theme song...
we bring you joy, we bring you strife? i wrote that.
you must be very proud of yourself.
it's really nothing.
look at this.
they're all on the censored list.
and look what we have here.
this looks like black market clothing.
 and you wrote the network jingle.  come on. everybody does it.
money.
that's what i need. money.
money's not going to do you any good. you don't have a travel pass.
you do.
now i do.
let's see.
now, where should we go?
maybe someplace warm. i need to work on my tan anyway.
you get so pale in prison.
there you are.
good. now, i'm going to untie you.
and then you're gonna get dressed.
and then you're gonna come with me.
oh, yeah? well, why should i?
because i'm going to say please.
well, why didn't you say so?
all flights to pretoria, tutuville and mandelaburg are on schedule.
flights to anaconda, chile, are delayed several hours.
all mideast flights are canceled until further notice.
you'll never pull this off.
you are unarmed, outnumbered.
face it, you're screwed.
so why don't you forget about all this and turn yourself in?
you know...
you have a very negative attitude.
now remember, i can break your neck like a chicken's.
travel pass.
what a beautiful day today.
i can practically taste those pia coladas.
 right, sweetheart?  miss?
you didn't put it in your purse again, did you?
last vacation she put my credit cards in there, and we couldn't find them.
 here. could you hold this, please?  you want to move it up there?
we got a plane to catch.
go on! go on!
you can't live with them...
 and you can't live without them.  this is ridiculous!
i'm warning you, i get sick...
air sick, car sick.
i'm gonna throw up all over you.
go ahead. it won't show on this shirt.
help! he's ben richards!
he's trying to kidnap me! help!
positive id. benjamin a. richards.
priority-one fugitive. all units, terminal seven.
all right. we're on him. close in!
go! go! move!
you move and you're dead!
hi, cutie pie.
you know, one of us is in deep trouble.
you know who i am?
i've seen you before.
you're the asshole on tv.
that's funny. i was gonna say the same thing about you.
i saw the video of your prison break. sensational.
ben, i think we might be able to help each other out.
i've got the brains, and you've got talent.
you've got more. you've got talent...
you've got charisma, and you've got balls.
that's why i pulled a few strings to get you here.
and that's why...
i'd like you to volunteer to appear..
on tomorrow's broadcast of the running man.
fuck you.
you're a brilliant conversationalist. a trifle limited, but brilliant.
take a look.
isn't that your old schoolteacher buddy there? huh?
there's your other buddy who helped you in the prison infirmary.
weiss. laughlin. what are you gonna do with them?
well, that's really up to you, ben.
you see, i created the running man, but i don't make the rules.
i got a contract with the government.
they send me the convicts, i put them on the show. you've seen it.
you know at least you've got a chance.
but your buddies, ben...
get the b list.
so if you don't do the running man tomorrow...
weiss and laughlin...
are gonna go on...
in your place.
what do you say?
we'll see how far this clown runs when we're done with him.
starting barium iv.
that's a go.
reading all systems down the line.
your bird is singing loud and clear
all systems check out.
mandibular restraint.
interphalangic injection.
deltoid i m injection.
 procedure completed.  takes care of him.
sons of bitches!
he's wrapped. knock him out till show time.
these guys never stop competing.
i get thirsty just watching them, and in my line of work...
i can't afford that filled up feeling.
that's why i drink cadre cola.
it hits the spot.
the capture of renegade police officer and mass murderer ben richards...
was filmed yesterday by runway security cameras.
richards's hostage, amber mendez, was unharmed.
some airport personnel were not so lucky...
like the ticket agent and security guard richards shot at point blank range...
when he arrived at the airport.
 but that's not true.  they were taken to cadre hospital...
where they remain in guarded condition.
and now, back to climbing for dollars.
mr richards.
i'm your court-appointed theatrical agent.
it's time.
and digital effects number one.
roll process mod.
okay, you guys. hey, here we are.
hey, over here! here!
big crowd tonight.
better there than in the streets.
who's your number one stalker?
hey, buzzsaw! slice those runners for me!
he touched me! you guys see that? buzzsaw touched me!
don't touch the hair!
go!
look, do you have any more change? i ran out.
 yes.  six dollars. jesus, this place...
you're lucky to be alive. i mean, that guy, he's killed, what...
 not according to him, he hasn't.  that's what they all say.
whereas the victim contests this...
and whereas network and victim have in past been combatants...
ad hoc de facto...
the parties herein have agreed to disagree.
this is mutually consented to be de jure...
and therefore parties have certain obligations to each other
respective rights and obligations...
boy.
lucky he didn't kill you too...
or rape you and kill you...
or kill you, then rape you.
conflicts between your estate...
i mean, a guy like that...
what would stop him?
yeah.
what would?
look, amy, i have to pass on that drink.
i just remembered i have some paperwork to do.
 i'll catch you tomorrow, okay?  the producer of the running man...
and everyone's favorite showman...
damon killian!
yeah! thank you! you're beautiful!
i love you. yes!
you're beautiful!
thank you!
shh!
it's...
show time!
yeah!
all right! now, tell me.
what's the number one television show...
in the whole wide world?
the running man!
and who loves you, and who do you love?
damon!
one more time!
damon!
yes!
phil, my announcer
i heard the warmup today, and i got to tell you...
honestly, phil, i don't think i've ever heard you funnier
i'm just kidding, guys. you're great at your job.
too bad it isn't music.
ad infinitum for cassettes...
videotapes, bubble chips...
and all other methods of recordings known or unknown.
sign here.
here, here. use my back, victim.
don't forget to send me a copy.
the love of my life, my number one fan...
mrs. mcardle!
 how you doin'?  just fine.
i want a big kiss, now, but remember, no tongues.
 bless you.  sit down, little darling.
we have one hell of a show for you tonight.
phil, please, if you will...
introduce tonight's guest runner..
and watch that screen.
our star runner tonight needs no introduction.
he's ben richards...
the brutal slayer of 60 men, women and children...
in the bakersfield massacre.
food riot in progress.
approximately 1,500 civilians.
moving in.
yankee nine-niner, the crowd is unarmed.
repeat, unarmed. abort attack.
 acknowledge, yankee nine-niner  the hell with you.
lt. sanders, take command. detain richards and return to base.
acknowledge, yankee nine-niner acknowledge! return to base!
those are innocent, unarmed people down there! cease fire! cease fire!
well, we all know the aftermath...
grieving parents...
orphaned children...
and a nation shocked to its very core.
here he is...
ready to pay the price for our home audience...
in person...
the butcher of bakersfield!
now, ben richards could have gone to prison...
but instead, he volunteered for the running man.
 risking everything for a chance...  excuse me.
at our fabulous prizes, like a trial by jury, suspended sentence...
maybe even a full pardon...
like our previous winners whitman, price and haddad!
you remember them. whitman, price and haddad!
there they are! and at this very moment...
they're basking under the maui sun...
their debt to society...
paid in full.
speaking of prizes, you don't have to be a menace to society to be a winner..
'cause you folks in the audience will get a chance too.
phil, tell our friends what they can win today.
damon, how about a year's supply of orthopure procreation pills...
adult and kiddie sizes, and the latest edition of the running man home game.
ben, i know you're dying to get into that game zone...
and show us the same determination you showed up in bakersfield.
well, first, i've got a little surprise for you.
we all know you're a big, tough guy, ben...
but that doesn't mean you're a loner
and it takes a big man to admit that he needs his friends.
we didn't want to break up a winning team...
so here they are, ready to go for broke...
right by your side.
ladies and gentlemen, ben's buddies...
harold weiss and william laughlin.
son of a bitch!
you know how this works.
the game zone is divided into 400 square blocks...
left over from the big quake of '97.
i don't think any of us will ever forget that.
once inside the zone, the runners have three hours.
they've got to go through all four game quads.
three hours or less, and they're gonna need every second.
 'cause you know who's on their tail?  the stalkers!
 who?  the stalkers!
and you know what happens then!
anything goes!
 what?  anything goes!
right! without further ado...
it's time to start running!
on your marks, get set...
killian.
i'll be back.
only in a rerun.
go!
 go!  you son of a bitch!
go!
yes!
all systems go.
vacuum sleds passing checkpoint one.
edited for television.
raw footage.
edith wiggins, come on down!
whoa, whoa, edith.
you look like you might have done a little stalking yourself.
all right. now, we need you to give me the name...
of the stalker that we send out to hunt down those three desperate criminals.
give me 10 seconds, please.
come on, come on. place your bets.
dynamo, 3 to 1.
time's up.
no more bets.
back off! come on!
i don't know. they're all so good.
quickly!
my husband and my little boy have their favorites.
 but i like my men big and cuddly.  yeah? who is it?
subzero!
all right! okay!
we're looking for subzero!
yeah!
and now, our first stalker of the evening...
a cadre trophy champion with over 30 lifetime kills.
let's welcome the incredible iceman, who slices his enemies limb from limb...
into quivering, bloody sushi...
professor subzero!
damon, here in the locker room...
there's a lot of excitement here, a lot of adrenaline.
the stalkers know there's 400 square blocks of game zone out there...
and anything can happen in the next three hours.
 i remember once when i was...  sorry, cap. just been informed...
the runners have entered the first quad.
let's go there now, live!
 faster!  get going.
come on. bring your money. give it to me!
first blood. you pay your money, you make your choice.
hey. how about you?
it's cold.
what is this?
i guess they want us to stay.
subzero does it again!
a triple hit!
let's get out of here!
weiss, come on! go!
oh, look at this. an ics home video. yeah!
and the running man...
home version right here for you.
get me out of here, you guys!
hang on, weiss. i'm coming.
come on, big boy!
get me out of here, you guys!
will, look out!
kill that son of a bitch!
come on! yeah! yeah!
hey, killian!
here is subzero.
now plain zero.
ladies and gentlemen, this is... just horrible.
words can't express what we're all feeling...
at this very moment.
a great champion has fallen.
we'll be back right after these important messages.
pull!
 you all right?  yeah. boy.
what the hell is that?
 it's gas.  let's get out of here.
sure glad we took care of subzero.
yeah, he was a real pain in the neck.
huh? i know a stalker died.
well, it had to happen sooner or later
yeah, well, it is a contact sport, right?
yes, but you guys at justice, you cannot have it both ways.
you want ratings, you want people in front of the tv sets...
instead of picket lines.
well, you ain't gonna get that with reruns of gilligan's island.
gilligan's island.
yeah, the one with the boat.
buzzsaw! buzzsaw! buzzsaw!
fireball! fireball!
yeah, buzzsaw!
leon.
i don't know. i think maybe dynamo...
but buzzsaw was last year's champion.
 i can't decide.  then don't decide, leon.
hard decisions call for hard solutions.
and here are two hard asses ready to step in and take charge.
you asked for 'em, leon. you got 'em.
here they are... buzzsaw and dynamo!
phil, tell us all about this champion tag team.
let's give a downhome welcome to buzzsaw eddie vatowski...
last season's leading stalker
buzzsaw's hammond and gage chain saws
are made of triloncoated durasteel...
and can cut muscle, sinew, bone or even solid steel!
 well?  the ratings just jumped eight points.
 eight?  make that nine.
 i love ben richards.  want another surprise?
what?
remember the girl who was with richards at the airport?
 the one with the cute ass?  this is cuter
they just caught her downstairs. she was pulling the bakersfield video.
would you please welcome...
 sensational.  our third stalker, dynamo!
thank you. you're beautiful. it's been an exciting show so far, right?
we've had shocks, we've had surprises.
and we thought, why not one more surprise?
will you please help me welcome our mystery contestant...
miss amber mendez!
let me go!
amber! now, i understand...
that you're single, amber..
and that you live on the west side.
not surprisingly, she's flaunted the law...
and traditional morality all of her life.
go ahead. tell some lies about me now.
we don't lie. phil, tell us all about her
 it's clear come on.  weiss, what is it?
the camera relay. it's pointing into the zone, not up.
who gives a damn?
hey, where are you going?
later, she cheated on college exams...
had sexual relationships with two...
sometimes three different men in a year..
and then she met mad dog ben richards...
her confederate, her lover
that was a lie!
dear, dear, dear let's reunite these little lovebirds.
go!
it's got to be here somewhere.
 want to tell me what is going on?  all the relays are the same.
they point into the middle of the game zone. sooner or later they'll connect...
which means the uplink to the network satellite is in there.
no wonder mic's people couldn't find it. no one ever comes out here.
if we find that uplink, we can crack the code.
we'll get it to mic, and he'll jam the network.
 jam the network?  that's right.
jam it up your ass. forget this crazy business.
you're gonna get us all killed. we got to move on.
let's go! move!
christ!
stalkers, we've got a bead...
come on, brothers! let's win one for the 'zero!
uplinks. underground. uplinks. underground.
you guys don't shut up, i'm going to uplink your ass...
and you'll be underground!
watch out! the lights!
 let's get out of here!  shh!
someone's coming.
hey, richards, wait! it's amber!
what the hell are you doing here?
you don't have to beat the crap out of me! think i'm glad to be here?
who the hell is this?
she turned me in at the airport. guess this is her reward.
yeah, go ahead. make jokes.
it's your fault i'm here.
the police think i'm helping you out. they even think i'm your girlfriend.
i can straighten that out. see this camera up there?
i can strangle you for the home audience.
 another relay. quick! it's around here.  weiss!
 what's he talking about?  come on. let's go.
weiss, over here!
richards! look out!
 you son of a bitch!  wait!
richards, help!
 yeah?  yeah. let's go.
give me your money. okay.
hey, man, what are you doing? hey!
the resistance has been trying to jam the network for five years.
this could be our chance.
 let's go!  no. this is more important.
 the uplink to the network satellite.  but he's gonna find us.
weiss, come on.
over there.
who loves you, and who do you love?
let me hear it.
you've got it.
who loves you, and who do you love?
hang on. i've got you.
run! get out of here!
laughlin, get up!
go! go! go!
go! go! go!
 there you go, leon.  oh, wow! yeah!
the running man home game.
it's okay, man.
don't worry. don't worry. you'll make more money.
let's get out of here. he's gonna find us.
 jackpot!  what are you doing? weiss?
what are you doing?
 what's this, weiss?  it's the uplink interface. look out.
great! hexagonal decode system.
not impossible. just gonna take a little time.
 your name is amber, right?  yeah.
okay, amber i need you to remember these numbers.
we've got to get them to mic and the resistance.
all right. i will! then let's go!
richards!
i love this saw.
this saw is part of me.
and i'm gonna make it part of you!
that's all right.
keep it!
god!
come on.
 18, 24.  61.
b.
say them. say them!
 not yet.  not yet? what do you mean?
four
 come to me, my love.  oh, my god.
no!
let me go! richards!
hey! light head!
 hey, christmas tree!  richards!
oh, shit!
all right!
follow me, light bulb!
got you!
come on!
all right!
oh, god! i'm stuck!
somebody, help me!
god, cut! go to commercials!
jesus christ! i have no power
cut! go to commercial!
kill him!
i won't kill a helpless human being.
not even sadistic scum like you.
 oh, my god!  boo!
come on!
do it!
what happened to buzzsaw?
he had to split.
hey, what an incredible battle!
buzzsaw gone...
dynamo down...
but the stalk isn't over till the fat lady sings...
and the very last criminal...
fireball, report to wardrobe at once.
fireball, you're wanted in wardrobe.
and our halftime show!
laughlin, break's over
come on. let's get going.
i'm going somewhere, but not with you.
buzzsaw took care of my... traveling arrangements.
oh, my god.
weiss?
he's dead.
but he gave me the code.
the satellite uplink code.
the underground has a broadcast center..
in quadrant four
take her take her and the code to mic.
don't let us die for nothin'.
we're countin' on you.
don't let us down.
i don't want to be the only asshole in heaven...
ben.
he saved my life.
it should be me down there.
we got him? hey, ben?
i got to hand it to you, pal.
you got the whole network here in an uproar
they're shipping bicarb to the justice department in crates.
so that's why this little call is just between you and i.
it's not on the air
listen very carefully, ben.
how would you like a three-year contract, guaranteed...
a cadre credit line...
and a beachfront condo?
sound impossible?
ben, that's the standard deal for a network stalker
i know real talent...
when i see it, ben, and i'd hate to see you get canceled tonight...
when you could go the distance.
say the word, ben, and you could be the one doing the stalking.
what do you think?
you coldblooded bastard. i'll tell you what i think of it.
i'll live to see you eat that contract.
but i hope you leave room for my fist...
because i'm going to ram it into your stomach...
and break your goddamn spine!
damon, it's for you.
 who?  it's the attorney general.
get out. everybody out.
come on. move.
yes.
fireball! fireball! fireball! fireball!
come on, fireball!
let's go!
he's my hero!
there he goes. fireball's on his way.
and dynamo's down but not out. back to you, damon.
hey! all right, agnes.
listen now. big chance for you. win a whole lot of prizes.
you know we've still got two crack stalkers out there, right?
dynamo and fireball.
who do you think will make the next kill?
oh, boy. that's a tough one.
give it a try. you can do it. who do you think?
i think the next kill...
will be made by... ben richards.
 she can't do that!  hold it.
agnes. richards is a runner you've got to pick a stalker
i can pick anyone i choose...
and i choose...
ben richards.
that boy's one mean motherfucker
$200 on richards!
come on! 200 on richards!
$200 on richards! come on!
just do it?
yeah, just do it. write it down, man.
 you want it? you got it.  yeah. all right!
place your bet! 25!
secret broadcast center, my ass! i don't know what laughlin was talking about.
there's nothing out here.
me and my big mouth! we should have taken that trip to hawaii.
i had the shirt for it, but you fucked it up.
jesus christ!
guess again.
you're dead, sucker!
come on. keep up.
i'm running too fast. my feet can't keep up!
there he goes! the number one rusher!
he smells blood...
and nothing on earth is gonna stop him!
wait. i don't want to go.
here. this way.
why here? i want to go that way.
let go of me. put me down.
you're going to get us killed.
stop it!
let me go!
burn 'em good!
amber, get out of here!
go! now!
amber!
richards.
richards.
richards.
whitman.
and price.
haddad.
they're running men.
last season's winners.
no. last season's losers.
my gas line! my gas line!
go to commercial!
how about a light?
what a hothead.
 byebye, fireball!  all right!
yeah, richards!
captain freedom to wardrobe on the double.
forget it, killian! i won't do it.
it's not a request, moron. it's an order
i don't need this crap.
this stuff is... garbage!
l...
i was killin' guys like this ten years ago with my bare hands!
i'm not going for any of these tricks.
this is a sport of death and honor
code of the gladiators!
will you spare me the combat zen speech.
what the hell's the matter with you?
can't you see what's going on out there?
this isn't a game!
they're betting on richards up there!
bullshit!
get outta here!
get him out of here!
what's the matter? steroids make you deaf?
get him out of here now!
now what?
let's find mic's secret broadcast center..
if it even exists.
oh, shit!
let's try that way.
we're trapped.
subzero...
fireball...
and buzzsaw.
say their names with reverent pride.
they punished crime and served the law.
as patriots they died.
this is what i hate. third act problems!
roll...
stock.
freeze in digital memory.
and...
activate traveling matte.
tony, this better work...
or you'll be a digital memory.
take it easy, damon.
we're loading richards's image onto the database.
when he's mapped onto the stunt double, you'll never know the difference.
all right, boys. let's see you dance.
sensational. i love it!
mr richards.
i'm surprised you're so easily caught.
welcome to the people's network. we've been waiting for you.
this is nice, mic.
it would have been nicer if you'd gotten off your asses and helped us out there.
we couldn't.
we'd have been seen, and the government would have found this place.
laughlin, weiss would have died for nothing.
they didn't.
i have the uplink code.
ladies and gentlemen, i've just got an update...
on tonight's incredible action.
the runners have entered the final quad...
and captain freedom has hung up his announcer's mike...
and come out of retirement.
he's suited up and ready for the final conflict.
let's go now, live, to the game zone!
yes! it's all over! what a colossal fight!
this is an incredible moment in sports.
captain freedom, out of retirement and still undefeated champion.
proving once again that right and might are one and the same!
damn that killian!
what's wrong? you should be happy.
we're officially dead. we can go anywhere, do anything.
no. don't you understand it?
they'll never let us out alive. they can't afford it.
they'll get the police, the army and hunt us down like dogs!
off camera, of course.
okay. dismantle all the overlays.
put the digital matte in the pixel memory storage.
the damn thing worked like a charm.
it should. editel charged us an arm and a leg for the software.
damon! you didn't have to kill him!
it's all a part of life's rich pattern, brenda...
and you better fuckin' get used to it.
that's one for the awards show.
thank you. you're doing nice work. i thank you.
tony, you're finally getting it.
guns. you don't need guns to jam a satellite.
i do. to keep it.
the minute i steal the signal...
the network will try to shunt the next one in orbit.
stevie's group is going inside to stop them now.
these kids?
this is a bad move, mic.
they need a leader, someone with experience.
i thought you were looking for the door
i told killian i'd be back.
i wouldn't want to be a liar
listen up, everybody.
i want you all to consider yourselves picked up...
for the rest of the season.
what, are you my people or an oil painting?
we're up nine points.
come on, now. let's go, champ.
we're going to send the uplink code in 20 minutes.
ten seconds later, i'll go on the air
 we'll be ready.  if you want to make an impression...
forget the speech.
try this instead.
what is it?
the original video from the bakersfield massacre...
before they edited for broadcasting.
where did you hide that?
it's none of your business.
hey, what the hell?
six minutes.
begin satellite coding sequence.
load uplink code into transponder grid.
shunt power to main circuits.
mr spock, you have the conn.
who's mr spock?
come on. let me hear it now.
oh, yeah!
welcome to the postgame wrapup show!
ladies, i love you.
thank you, young man.
hello! you're on the air
hi, damon. my name is wendy. i have a question about dynamo.
 is he seriously hurt?  he's gonna be fine, love.
 fortunately, it seems...  good luck.
dynamo was still under factory warranty.
you too.
you're on the air
i feel bad about the dead stalkers.
is there any way i can make a donation to help out their families?
what a darling you are. yes, my dove.
all you do is send your checks to the patriots' fund...
care of this station...
three...
two...
one.
that's it. we got that baby!
those contributions are tax deductible.
and who loves you, and who do you love?
damon!
yes! yes! yes!
hey, what's going on?
we don't lie.
like our previous winners...
whitman, price and haddad.
you remember them.
there they are at this very moment...
basking under the maui sun...
their debt to society paid in full.
watch...
that screen.
yankee nine-niner what's the status of the crowd?
food riot in progress.
approximately 1,500 civilians.
no weapons are evident.
proceed with plan alpha.
 eliminate anything moving.  i said the crowd is unarmed.
there are lots of women and children down there.
all they want is some food!
as you were, richards! proceed with plan alpha.
all rioters must be eliminated.
the hell with you. i will not fire at helpless human beings.
 where's it coming from?  the network satellite.
abort mission. return to base.
don't touch that dial.
detain richards and proceed as ordered.
richards, what are you doing?
ladies and gentlemen!
if you'll please bear with us!
we're experiencing technical difficulties!
bullshit!
it's show time!
get the people out! come on!
thought it was pretty funny out there in the zone.
what's the matter now, bitch?
why aren't you laughing?
because there's nothing funny about a dickless moron...
with a battery up his ass!
out! out!
i'll show you dickless!
 get out of my way!  get down! down!
let's go!
hello, cutie pie.
one of us is in deep trouble.
sven, do you want to talk to mr richards?
well?
i got to score some steroids.
you look pissed.
believe me, you got every right to be.
but, hey, will you just let me explain?
this is television. that's all it is.
it's nothing to do with people. it's to do with the ratings.
for 50 years, we've told them what to eat...
what to drink, what to wear
for christ's sake, don't you understand?
americans love television.
they wean their kids on it.
they love game shows, they love wrestling.
they love sports and violence.
so what do we do? we give 'em what they want!
we're number one, ben. that's all that counts.
believe me. i've been in the business 30 years.
i haven't been in show business as long as you have...
but i'm a quick learner..
so i'm going to give the audience what i think they want.
you bastard! drop dead!
i don't do requests.
no!
that hit the spot.
yeah!
all right! yeah!
richards! richards! richards! richards!
richards! richards! richards! richards!
the running man has been brought to you by...
breakaway paramilitary uniforms...
orthopure procreation pill...
and cadre cola... it hits the spot.
promotional considerations paid for by...
kelton flamethrowers...
wainwright electrical launchers...
and hammond and gage chain saws.
damon killian's wardrobe by chez antoine...
cadre trooper and studio guard sidearms...
provided by colchester, the pistol of patriots.
remember, tickets for the ics studio tour are always available...
for classa citizens in good standing.
if you'd like to be a contestant on the running man...
send a self-addressed, stamped envelope...
to ics talent hunt, care of your local affliate...
and then go out and do something really despicable.
i'm phil hilton. good night and take care.

doug?
honey, are you all right?
you're dreaming.
was it about mars?
is that better?
my poor baby.
this is getting to be an obsession.
was she there?
who?
the one you told me about. the brunette.
lori.
i can't believe you're jealous of a dream.
 who is she?  nobody.
nobody? what's her name?
i don't know.
 tell me!  i don't know!
you better tell me!
it's not funny, doug. you dream about her every night.
and i'm always back in the morning.
let me go!
come on, baby.
you know you're the girl of my dreams.
you mean it?
you know i do.
i'll give you something to dream about.
the chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons...
the chairman defended the attack, saying that space-based weapons...
are our only defense against the southern block's numerical superiority.
and more violence last night on mars...
where terrorists demanding independence...
once again halted the extraction of terbinium ore.
kuato and his socalled freedom brigade...
claimed credit for this latest bombing,
which attempted to reopen the sealed off pyramid mines.
mars military restored order with minimal use of force...
and all damage to the strategic facility was repaired within hours.
no cameras!
with one mine already closed, mars administrator vilos cohaagen...
vowed that troops would be used if necessary...
to keep production at full capacity.
no wonder you're having nightmares. you're always watching the news.
 lori.  doug?
 let's do it.  do what?
move to mars.
why do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning?
just think about it.
we've been through this before. you'd hate it on mars.
it's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.
i mean, really, a revolution could break out there any second.
cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
you believe him?
okay. forget about it.
absolutely not. mars was colonized by the northern block at enormous expense.
our entire war effort depends on their terbinium.
it's absurd to think we'd give it away...
just because some lazy mutants think they own the planet.
 maybe we should take a trip.  any comment on the rumor..
 lori, move.  that you've closed the pyramid mine...
because you found alien artifacts inside?
there's a lot better places than mars.
what about saturn? don't you wanna see saturn?
i wish we could find some artifacts. our tourist industry could use a boost.
everybody says that its gorgeous.
the fact is, it's mr kuato and his terrorists who spread these rumors...
to undermine trust in the government.
we could take a long space cruise, the kind with nothing to do.
 have you found kuato yet?  we don't even know what he looks like.
 what do you say?  that's the news.
 stay tuned for weather  i'm late.
but first, this.
 tonight, world series game five...  sweetheart.
live from tokyo.
i know it's hard being in a new town, but let's give it a chance, okay?
don't you understand? i feel like i was made for something more than this.
i want to do something with my life, to be somebody.
you are somebody.
you're the man i love.
bye.
have a nice day.
you are now entering a safety zone.
no unauthorized weapons allowed beyond this point.
would you like to ski...
but you're snowed under with work?
do you dream of a vacation at the bottom of the ocean...
but you can't float the bill?
have you always wanted to climb the mountains of mars...
but now you're over the hill?
then come to rekall incorporated...
where you can buy the memory of your ideal vacation...
cheaper, safer and better than the real thing.
so don't let life pass you by.
call rekall for the memory of a lifetime.
for the memory of a lifetime
rekall, rekall, rekall
harry.
 you ever hear of rekall?  rekall?
where they sell those fake memories.
oh, rekall.
 thinking of going there?  maybe.
 well, don't.  why not?
a friend of mine tried it, nearly got himself lobotomized.
no shit?
don't fuck with your brain. it ain't worth it.
i guess not.
good afternoon. welcome to rekall.
douglas quaid. i have an appointment.
 bob?  yeah?
 doug quaid is here to see you.  i'll be right out.
just one minute, mr quaid.
thank you.
 paul mcclane. good to see you.  nice to meet you.
come on in.
 make yourself comfortable.  thank you.
help me out here, doug.
 you were interested in a memory of  mars.
yeah. mars.
is there a problem?
to be perfectly honest...
if you like outer space...
you'd be happier with one of our saturn cruises.
i'm not interested in saturn. i said mars.
okay. you're the boss.
mars it is.
now, let me see.
the basic mars package...
will run you 899 credits.
now, that's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.
a longer trip is more expensive because it's a deeper implant.
what's in the two-week package?
when you go rekall, you get nothing but first-class memories.
private shuttle cabin, deluxe suite at the hilton, all the major sights:
mount pyramid, the grand canals...
and, of course, venusville.
but how real does it seem?
 as real as any memory in your head.  don't bullshit me.
i'm telling you, your brain will not know the difference.
that's guaranteed or your money back.
what about the guy you lobotomized? did he get a refund?
you're talking ancient history.
nowadays traveling with rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.
check out those statistics.
besides, a real holiday is a pain in the butt.
you got lost luggage, lousy weather..
crooked taxi drivers.
when you travel with rekall...
everything is perfect.
what do you say?
 all right.  smart move.
while you fill out this questionnaire,
i'll familiarize you with some of our options.
no options.
whatever you say. let me ask you one question.
what is exactly the same...
about every single vacation you have ever taken?
i give up.
you. you're the same.
no matter where you go, it's always you.
let me suggest that you take a vacation...
from yourself.
i know, it sounds wild.
it is the latest thing in travel. we call it the ego trip.
i'm not interested.
you're gonna love this, doug.
we offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
why go to mars as a tourist when you can go as a playboy...
or a famous jock or
secret agent.
how much is that?
let me tantalize you.
you are a top operative under deep cover on your most important mission.
people are trying to kill you.
you meet this beautiful, exotic woman.
go on.
i don't wanna spoil it for you...
but by the time the trip is over..
you get the girl, kill the bad guys and save the entire planet.
now, you tell me.
isn't that worth a measly 300 credits?
your first trip?
don't worry. things hardly ever fuck up around here.
good evening... doug.
 i'm dr lull.  nice to meet you.
ernie, patch in matrix 62b37.
would you like us to integrate some alien stuff?
sure. why not?
two-headed monsters?
don't you watch the news?
 we're doing alien artifacts now.  it's wild.
yeah, they date back a million years.
 ernie?  that's a new one.
 blue sky on mars.  been married long?
 eight years.  oh, i see.
slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
 no. i'm fascinated with mars.  all systems go.
number seven.
ready for dreamland?
i'll be asking you some questions so we can fine-tune the ego program.
you answer honestly, you'll enjoy yourself much more.
 your sexual orientation.  hetero.
how do you like your women?
blonde? brunette? redhead?
brunette.
slim. athletic. voluptuous.
athletic.
demure. aggressive. sleazy.
be honest.
sleazy.
demure.
boy, is he gonna have a wild time.
 he's not gonna want to come back.  that's for sure.
so...
what do you say?
i'm not so sure, and i don't get a souvenir
not true. we supply t-shirts, snapshots of you at the site...
and even letters from
 what is it?  get down here.
i am with a very important client.
looks like we got another schizoid embolism.
i'll be right back.
mr mcclane?
bob! what's wrong?
don't let her leave!
get off!
you blew my cover!
you can't do a simple goddamn double implant?
we hit a memory cap.
they're coming! they'll kill you all!
 what is he talking about?  let me go!
mr quaid, try to calm down!
my name is not quaid.
 let me go! untie me now!  ernie, grab his leg!
 hold him down!  let me go!
are you all right?
listen to me. he's been going on and on about mars.
 he has really been there.  use your head.
he's just acting out the secret agent portion of his ego trip.
 that's not possible.  why not?
we haven't implanted it yet.
oh, shit.
i've been trying to tell you, someone has erased his memory.
excuse me.
someone?
we're talking about the agency.
 shut up!  bob, the client's gone.
renata, cover up any memory he's got of us or rekall.
i'll try. it's pretty messy in there.
ernie, dump him in a cab. tiffany, you help him.
i'm gonna destroy his file and refund his money.
and if anybody comes asking, we never heard of douglas quaid.
where am l?
you're in a johnnycab.
what am i doing here?
i'm sorry. would you please rephrase the question?
how did i get in this taxi?
the door opened, you got in.
hell of a day, isn't it?
 this okay?  right here.
 thank you for taking johnnycab.  thank you.
hope you enjoyed the ride.
hey, quaid.
 harry.  how was your trip to mars?
 what trip?  you went to rekall. remember?
 i did?  yeah, you did.
 i told you not to, but you went.  what are you, my father?
 come on, i'll buy you a drink.  thank you. i'm already late
okay, bring him come on, move it!
let's go get that drink. move it!
what is going on? what the fuck did i do wrong?
 tell me!  you blabbed about mars!
are you crazy? i don't even know anything about mars!
you should've listened to me, quaid. i was there to keep you out of trouble.
you're making a big mistake. you got me mixed up with somebody else.
you got yourself mixed up with
and pivot... and serve...
and shift... and stroke...
very good. perfect form.
hi, honey.
 what are you doing? some men just tried to kill me.
muggers? are you all right?
no, they were spies or something.
harry, from work, he was the get down!
 harry was the boss.  take it easy, doug, okay?
 why would spies want to kill you?  i don't know.
 it had something to do with mars.  you've never been to mars.
it sounds crazy, but i went to this rekall place after work
 those brain butchers?  let me finish.
 what did they do to you? i got a trip to mars.
forget about rekall. they were going to kill me.
 doug, nobody tried to kill you.  they did.
but i killed them.
listen, sweetheart. those assholes at rekall have fucked up your mind.
you're having paranoid delusions.
you call this a delusion?
 doug, i'm gonna call a doctor  don't. don't call anybody.
lori, go! get out!
why are you doing this?
talk!
 i'm not your wife.  the hell you're not.
i never saw you before six weeks ago.
our marriage is just a memory implant.
you think i'm stupid? i remember our wedding.
it was an agency implant.
 falling in love.  implanted.
our friends, my job, 8 years together all of this was implanted?
the job's real. the agency set it up.
bullshit.
they erased your identity and implanted a new one.
i was written in as your wife so i could make sure the erasure took.
sorry, quaid.
your whole life is just a dream.
okay, then if i'm not me, who the hell am l?
beats me.
i just work here.
there's something i want you to know.
you were the best assignment i ever had. really.
i'm honored.
you sure you don't want to, just for old times' sake?
if you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
 i didn't know you were so kinky.  maybe it's time you found out.
clever girl.
you wouldn't shoot me, doug, after all we've been through.
some of it was fun.
nice knowing you.
don't touch her
nobody here.
 are you okay?  i guess i blew it.
 what does he remember?  nothing, so far
i've got him.
he's going for the subway. let's go.
let's go. move it.
pack your stuff and get outta here.
what if they bring him back?
not a chance.
subway! go!
get him! he's got a gun!
 cut him off! that way!  over there!
hold it!
the escalator
you four go up. you come with me.
get out of the way!
move!
the platform!
 which way?  to the right.
botco. tomorrow's fuels, tomorrow's prices.
don't settle for pale memories or fake implants.
experience space travel the old-fashioned way...
on a real, live holiday you can afford.
i want that fucker dead.
i don't blame you. i wouldn't want quaid porking my old lady.
 you saying she likes it?  no, i'm sure she hated every minute.
six-beta-nine, we have a live transmission from mr cohaagen.
 richter here.  patch it through.
 what is going on?  i'm trying to neutralize a traitor
i want him alive, you moron.
no. he knows too much.
lori says he can't remember anything.
in an hour he could have total recall.
listen to me, richter i want quaid delivered alive for reimplantation.
have you got that?
i want him back in place with lori.
did you hear me?
what was that, sir? i couldn't hear you.
i got quaid again.
switching to another channel. i've got sunspots.
 call him back!  i'm losing you.
 where is he?  second level, galleria.
we should've killed quaid on mars.
 how we doing?  fine.
zooming in.
we got him!
if you want to live, don't hang up.
 what do you want?  you've been bugged.
they'll be there in three minutes unless you do as i say.
don't bother searching. the bug's in your skull.
 who are you?  never mind.
wrap a wet towel around your head. that'll muffle the signal.
 how'd you find me?  i'd advise you to hurry.
this'll buy you some time. they won't be able to pinpoint you.
 shit!  what?
 i lost him.  well, find him!
yeah, right.
hurry up. you look beautiful.
now go to the window. go.
can you see me down here?
 this is the suitcase you gave me.  i gave you?
i'm gonna set it here. come and get it, keep moving.
 wait. wait.  what?
 who are you?  we were buddies in the agency on mars.
you asked me, if you disappeared, to find you, so here i am.
what was i doing on mars?
excuse me, but this is mine.
 i don't see your name on it.  someone left it for me.
 find your own bag.  i need it!
fuck you, you asshole!
he's gotta be around here somewhere.
that guy there.
hello, i'm johnnycab. where can i take you tonight?
drive. drive!
 please repeat the destination.  anywhere! just go! go!
please state the street and number
shit. shit!
i'm not familiar with that address. would you please repeat
fasten your seat belt!
the fare is 18 credits, please.
sue me, dickhead.
we hope you enjoyed the ride.
howdy, stranger this is hauser
if things have gone wrong, i'm talking to myself...
and you've got a wet towel wrapped around your head.
whatever your name is, get ready for the big surprise.
you are not you. you are me.
no shit.
six-beta-nine, six-beta-nine, come in.
did you find him?
we picked up an explosion at the old cement factory.
send two units. we'll meet you there.
all my life i've worked for mars intelligence.
i did cohaagen's dirty work.
but recently i met somebody a woman
and i learned a few things.
i've been playing for the wrong team.
all i can do now is try to make up for it.
there's enough shit in here to fuck cohaagen good.
but if you're listening to this, that means he has got to me first.
here comes the hard part.
now it is all up to you.
great.
 what have we got?  nothing here.
 he's gone.  i got a weak signal over there.
find him.
first let's get rid of that bug in your head.
take this thing out of the case and stick it up your nose.
don't worry. it's self-guiding.
just shove real hard.
when it crunches, you're there.
just pull it out.
be careful. it's my head too.
i've got a lock.
up. let's go.
this is the plan.
get your ass to mars...
go to the hilton and flash the brubaker i.d. at the desk.
that's it.
just do what i say and we can nail that bastard who fucked you and me.
i'm counting on you, buddy.
don't let me down.
straight ahead.
in there.
there!
give me that.
shit.
get your ass to mars get your ass to mars
welcome to the mars federal colony.
for your safety and comfort, domes have been installed...
to protect you from the vacuum outside.
please do not touch exterior windows or air locks.
air volume is limited. no smoking is allowed anywhere in the colony.
next.
thank you, and enjoy your stay on mars.
passport.
 get out of the way.  make way!
stand back.
mr cohaagen wants to see you right away.
any news of quaid?
 not since you lost him.  watch your mouth, captain.
 how long do you plan to stay?  two weeks.
look at that shit.
 what the hell's this?  the martians love kuato.
they think he's fuckin' george washington.
kill the bastard.
nobody knows who he is.
have you brought any fruits or vegetables?
two weeks.
excuse me?
two weeks.
it's not just graffiti. the rebels took over the refinery last night.
the rebels took over the refinery last night.
no terbinium is going out.
and it gets worse.
quaid.
 that's quaid!  where?
the woman! get him her!
arrest that woman!
grab her!
catch!
get ready for a surprise!
 open the goddamn door!  i can't!
open it!
they're all connected!
a few days ago cohaagen raised the price of air
 again?  nobody on earth cares about mars.
they just want our terbinium so they can fight their war
excuse me. what's that?
you mean the pyramid mine?
i used to work there until they found that alien shit inside.
well, that's a rumor, isn't it?
think so?
mr cohaagen.
you wanted to see me, sir?
richter..
do you know why i'm so happy?
no, sir
because i've got the greatest job in the solar system.
as long as the terbinium keeps flowing, i can do anything i want.
anything.
in fact...
my only worry is that one day...
if the rebels win...
it all might end...
and you're making it happen!
first you try to kill quaid, then he escapes.
he had help from our side, sir
i know that.
 but i thought  who told you to think?
i don't give you enough information to think.
you do what you're told. that's what you do.
yes, sir
let's get to business.
we've got a tricky situation here.
kuato wants what's in quaid's head.
he might be able to get it. they say he's psychic.
i have a plan to keep this from happening.
suppose you could play along?
 yes, sir  great.
otherwise, i'll erase your ass.
you need a taxi? i got magazines, music, whisky.
you need a cab? come on!
can i help you?
i would like a room, please.
nice to have you back, mr brubaker would you like the same suite?
definitely.
you've left something in our safe.
could you get it?
identification?
 i'll encode your room key.  thank you.
 suite 610 in the east wing.  thank you.
 could i borrow your pen, please?  certainly.
thank you.
hey, man, you need a cab?
 what's wrong with this one?  he ain't got five kids to feed.
 where's yours?  right over there.
hey, asshole! that's my fare!
eat this!
damn you, benny!
welcome to mars, man!
 what was that, an accident?  that's the rebels.
let's get outta here...
before they arrest us!
what do the rebels want?
the usual. more money, more freedom, more air
so, where to?
last resort.
you're getting off to an early start.
 first time on mars?  yes.
well, actually, no.
well, sort of.
the man don't even know whether he's been to mars or not.
voila. venusville.
hey, you see anything you like?
end of the line. we'd better walk from here.
i'll show you where.
 do you want to know the future?  what about the past?
it's around the corner, right down this alley.
they got everything.
not bad, huh?
read your palm? your mind? your aura? probe the secrets of your heart?
i bet i can guess your birthday.
 you're a taurus, right?  how did you guess?
 tell me, are all psychics  freaks?
afraid so. it goes with the territory.
 what happened to them?  cheap domes, no air to clean the rays.
this is it. the last resort. you sure you want to go in here?
 why not?  there's a better place down there.
the girls are cleaner, the liquor ain't watered down
sure, and you get kickbacks.
hey, man, i got five kids to feed.
take them to the dentist.
thanks, mister! i'll be waiting for you.
take your time. benny's the name.
 what do you want?  melina.
she's busy.
but mary here, she's free.
well, not free, honey, but...
available.
thanks. i'll wait for melina.
earth slime.
thing is, friend, mel's real picky.
she sticks to her regulars.
she'll like me.
mel!
hello, hauser
still bulging, i see.
 what you been feeding this thing?  blondes.
i think it's still hungry.
you got a lot of nerve showing your face around here, hauser.
look who's talking.
hey, tony, give the big guy a break.
relax. you'll live longer
come on.
 honey, take care of tony, will you?  no problem.
if you need any help with this one, give me a holler
you son of a bitch.
you're alive? i thought that cohaagen tortured you to death.
well, i guess he didn't.
and you couldn't get me a message? you never wondered what happened to me?
hauser, thank god you're alive.
melin melina. melina.
 i have to tell you something.  what?
 i don't remember you.  what are you talking about?
i don't remember you.
i don't remember us. i don't even remember me.
did you get amnesia? how did you get here?
 hauser left me a note.  you're hauser
not anymore.
now i'm quaid. douglas quaid.
 hauser, you've lost your mind.  no, cohaagen stole it.
he found out that hauser switched sides, so he turned him into somebody else: me.
this is too weird.
he dumped me on earth with a wife and a lousy job
did you say wife? are you fucking married?
 she wasn't really my wife.  oh, she isn't?
how stupid of me. she was hauser's wife?
 forget that i said wife.  let's just forget everything.
 i'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.  why would i lie to you?
because you're still working for cohaagen.
don't be ridiculous.
you never loved me, hauser
you just used me to get inside.
inside what?
i think you'd better leave.
melina, hauser sent me to do something. i'm not falling for it.
he says there's enough in here to nail cohaagen for good.
 get out!  you've got to help me remember!
 i said, get out!  melina, please!
people are trying to kill me.
really?
all right, i'm leaving.
baby, you make me wish i had three hands.
i think you're doing just fine with two.
excuse me, baby. we'll pick this up later
hey, that didn't take long.
let me ask you a question. did you ever fuck a mutant?
 take me to the hotel.  i know these siamese twins.
man, you won't know if you're coming or going.
this afternoon at 4:30 p.m., i signed an order declaring martial law...
this afternoon at 4:30 p.m., i signed an order declaring martial law...
throughout the mars federal colony.
i will not tolerate any further damage to our mineral export operations.
mr kuato and his terrorists must understand...
that their self-defeating efforts will only bring misery and suffering
mr quaid?
what?
i need to talk to you about mr hauser
 who are you?  dr edgemar from rekall.
 how did you find me?  it's difficult to explain.
could you open the door? i'm unarmed.
don't worry. i'm alone. may i come in?
 what do you want?  this will be hard for you to accept.
 i'm listening.  you're not really standing here now.
 doc, you could have fooled me.  i'm quite serious.
you're not here and neither am l.
that's amazing.
 where are we?  at rekall.
you're strapped into an implant chair..
and i'm monitoring you from the psychoprobe console.
ah, i get it. i'm dreaming.
and all this is part of the delightful vacation your company has sold me.
not exactly.
what you're experiencing is a freeform delusion based on our memory tapes...
but you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
if it is my delusion, who the hell invited you?
i've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.
i'm sorry to tell you this, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.
we can't snap you out of your fantasy...
and i've been sent in to try to talk you down.
how much is cohaagen paying you for this?
think about it. your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure.
everything after that the chases, the trip to mars...
the suite at the hilton are elements of your rekall holiday and ego trip.
you paid to be a secret agent.
bullshit. it's coincidence.
and what about the girl?
brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure?
just as you specified. is that coincidence?
she's real. i dreamt about her before i even went to rekall.
mr quaid.
can you hear yourself? she's real because you dreamed her?
 that's right.  maybe this will convince you.
would you mind opening the door?
 you open it.  no need to be rude.
i'll do it.
sweetheart?
come in, mrs. quaid.
 i suppose you're not here either  i'm here...
at rekall.
i love you.
right. that's why you tried to kill me.
no. i'd never do anything to hurt you.
i want you to come back to me.
 bullshit.  what's bullshit, mr quaid?
that you're having a paranoid episode triggered by acute neurochemical trauma?
or that you're really an invincible secret agent from mars...
who's the victim of an interplanetary conspiracy to make him think...
he's a lowly construction worker?
stop punishing yourself, doug.
you're a fine, upstanding man. you have a beautiful wife who loves you.
your whole life is ahead of you.
but you've got to want to return to reality.
let's assume i do. then what?
 swallow this.  what is it?
it's a symbol of your desire to return to reality.
inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
all right, let's say you're telling the truth and this is all a dream.
then i could pull this trigger and it won't matter
 doug, don't.  it won't make a difference to me.
but the consequences to you would be devastating. in your mind i'll be dead.
with no one to guide you out, you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.
doug, let dr edgemar help you.
the walls of reality will come crashing down.
one minute you'll be the savior of the rebel cause, and right after that...
you'll be cohaagen's bosom buddy.
you'll even have fantasies about alien civilizations, as you requested...
but in the end, back on earth you'll be lobotomized!
so get a grip on yourself, doug, and put down that gun!
good. now take the pill and put it in your mouth.
swallow it!
go ahead, sweetheart.
now you've done it. now you've done it!
that's for making me come to mars.
you know how much i hate this fucking planet!
cuff him.
i got him. bring him down in the service elevator
let's go.
fuck you!
doug.
honey...
you wouldn't hurt me, would you, sweetheart?
sweetheart, be reasonable.
after all, we're married.
consider that a divorce.
that was your wife?
what a bitch.
hey, get out of the way!
i thought you didn't like me.
if cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
 got it.  so you've come back to apologize.
kuato wants to see you.
come on.
 now what?  jump!
no! don't do it! you'll crack the fucking dome!
what are you trying to do, kill us? the dome will crack!
move!
taxi!
melina! melina!
 need a ride?  last resort.
you guys are going in circles.
jesus!
come on! you drive!
you guys are in trouble?
go! go!
 what are you trying to do to me?  shut up and drive!
hey, i got five kids to feed!
shit!
no brakes!
you idiot!
what are you doing?
christ! now they're after me!
give me that!
get out of the way!
tony!
get out of the way! come on!
come on! come on!
thank you, tony.
you wanna have some fun?
where are they?
what are you talking about? i don't know.
maybe you know.
kill them all!
thumbelina!
richter!
 a call from cohaagen!  richter here.
 we've got them pinned down.  stop fighting and pull out.
but they've got quaid. they're protecting him.
perfect. get out of sector g now.
don't think.
 do it!  yes, sir
pull 'em out.
everybody, pull out!
move!
 cohaagen's sealing off the area!  come on, benny!
the first settlers are buried here.
they worked themselves to death, but cohaagen ended up with all the money.
he built cheap domes and watched the kids turn into freaks.
i saw them.
and if you want to breathe, you have to buy his air
maybe you can change all that.
hey, i think my grandpa might be here.
so what can i do?
kuato's gonna make you remember some things you knew when you were hauser
 like what?  all sorts of things.
 maybe you'll remember you loved me.  i don't need kuato for that.
since when?
freeze!
come on, melina.
kuato's waiting.
i didn't find grandpa, but
oh, shit.
 who's this?  he helped us get away.
hey, don't worry about me, man. i'm on your side.
you're a mutant, huh?
all right, let's go.
 have you tried ramming down the door?  you wait here. follow me.
it won't do any good.
 cohaagen depressurized the tunnels.  then drill through to section m.
we can't. we're running out of air
we need help.
sit tight. melina just got here with quaid.
i hope he was worth it.
so do l.
 i'm glad you made it.  you don't look glad.
cohaagen sealed up venusville. he shut off the air
you must know something pretty important, quaid.
he wants you.
if we don't hand you over, everybody in this sector will be dead by morning.
then we don't have much choice.
we can't turn him in.
that's up to kuato. come with me, quaid.
sit down.
 where's kuato?  on his way.
you heard the rumors about the pyramid mine?
yeah.
cohaagen found something weird inside and it's got him scared shitless.
what? aliens?
 you tell me.  i don't know.
yes, you do. that's why we brought you here.
cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole...
you call a brain.
and kuato's gonna dig it out.
 you're kuato, right?  wrong.
kuato's a mutant, so don't get upset when you see him.
what do you want, mr quaid?
same as you: to remember
but why?
 to be myself again.  you are what you do.
a man is defined by his actions...
not his memory.
please...
take my hands.
now open your mind to me.
please.
open your mind.
open your mind.
open your mind.
open your mind.
open your mind.
we should blow the thing up before the rebels turn it on.
i say we throw the switch and see what happens.
 don't be an idiot.  we can't risk it.
the chain reaction could spread to all the terbinium in the planet.
that means a meltdown, a meltdown on a planetary scale.
don't you think whoever built this thing thought of that?
who knows what the hell they thought? they weren't human.
maybe it's a trap. maybe they want a meltdown.
we don't even know if this piece of junk will work.
what is it? a million? half a million?
 about half a million.  half a million years old.
let's make sure kuato
wake up! wake up! come on, wake up!
they found us! shit! let's go!
wake up! snap out of it! come on!
they found us!
 everybody out!  melina!
get moving! get out!
get out!
everybody out! get out!
get to the air lock! follow me!
benny, come on!
 benny!  i'm coming!
put these spacesuits on! we're going outside!
benny, hurry.
congratulations, quaid.
you led us right to him.
how can you do this? you're a mutant.
i got four kids to feed.
so what happened to number five?
shit, man. you got me.
i ain't even married.
now put your fucking hands in the air!
quaid.
quaid.
forget it, man. his fortunetelling days are over
start the reactor
free mars.
mr cohaagen would like to talk to you.
so this is the great man.
no wonder he kept out of sight.
well, my boy...
you're a hero.
fuck you.
don't be modest. kuato is dead.
the resistance is completely wiped out, and you were the key to the whole thing.
he's lying.
you twofaced bastard.
you can't blame him, angel. he's innocent.
you see, quaid, none of my people could get close to kuato.
fucking mutants could always sniff us out.
so hauser and i sat down and invented you, the perfect mole.
you know you're lying. hauser turned against you.
that's what we wanted you to think.
the fact is, hauser volunteered to become doug quaid.
it was the only way to fool the psychics.
get your story straight.
this idiot has been trying to kill me ever since i went to rekall.
you don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
he wasn't in on it. you set him off by going to rekall.
 so why am i still alive?  we gave you lots of help.
 benny here.  my pleasure, man.
the guy with the suitcase, the mask, the money...
the message from hauser, all of that was set up by us.
sorry. too perfect.
perfect, my ass!
you pop your memory cap before we can activate you.
richter goes hogwild, screwing up everything i spent a year planning.
frankly, i'm amazed it worked.
well, cohaagen...
i have to hand it to you. it's the best mindfuck yet.
well, don't take my word for it.
someone you trust wants to talk to you. who is it this time?
my mother?
howdy, quaid.
if you're listening to this, it means that kuato is dead...
and you have led us to him.
i knew you wouldn't let me down.
sorry for the shit i've put you through, but hey...
what are friends for?
i would like to wish you happiness and long life, old buddy...
but unfortunately, this is not gonna happen.
you see, it's my body you've got there and i want it back.
sorry to be an lndian giver, but i was here first.
so adios, amigo.
and thanks for not getting yourself killed.
hey, maybe we'll meet in our dreams.
you never know.
you bastards!
let go of me!
 ready?  auto.
 check.  ready to go, sir
relax, quaid.
 you'll like being hauser  the guy's a fucking asshole.
that's not true. he's one of my best friends.
besides, he's got a big house and a mercedes.
and you like melina, right? you'll get to fuck her every night.
that's right. she's going to be hauser's babe.
i'll bust his balls.
uhuh, princess.
we're having you fixed.
you're going to be respectful, compliant...
and appreciative, the way a woman should be.
mr cohaagen, telephone.
yes? what is it?
the oxygen level is bottoming out in sector g.
what do you want me to do about it?
 don't do anything.  but they won't last an hour, sir
fuck 'em.
it'll be a good lesson to the others.
you got what you want. give these people air
my friend, in five minutes you won't give a shit about the people.
fire it up, doc.
excuse me, doctor
 is he gonna remember any of this?  not a thing.
oh, really?
quaid, i'm having a party tonight.
why don't you and melina drop by. remind him, doc.
 sure.  see you at the party.
keep still. fighting just makes it hurt.
if you don't keep still, you'll end up psychotic.
hey, don't!
melina, hold on!
are you all right? are you still you?
i'm not sure, dear what do you think?
let's get the hell out of here.
you have to make a decision, sir
kill him.
it's about goddamn time.
 where are you going?  to the reactor
 what reactor?  the one in the mines. come on!
people are dying, quaid! stop! we've got to get air!
the reactor makes air that's cohaagen's secret. let's go.
where's this reactor come from?
 aliens built it.  aliens?
 are you sure about this?  it's just up ahead.
what the hell
quaid!
hey, quaid, you remember me?
benny! benny's the name!
oh, that's good!
i'm gonna drill you, sucker!
i'm gonna grind you up!
i'm coming!
i'm coming for you, baby!
what the fuck is this?
damn this piece of martian junk!
hey, quaid, i'm gonna squash you!
benny, here!
where the fuck are you?
screw you!
quaid, get over here!
what is it?
there's an opening.
i knew it.
this whole thing is one big reactor made out of terbinium.
cohaagen knows it makes air the bastard won't turn it on.
of course not.
if mars had an atmosphere, he'd lose control.
see down there?
it's a glacier
the whole core of mars is ice.
the reactor melts it...
and it releases the oxygen.
come on.
 enough for everyone to breathe?  sure.
enough for the whole planet.
if we turn it on in time.
come on. come on!
hold on.
now!
son of a bitch.
go!
he's got a hologram!
you think this is the real quaid? it is.
you're coming with me!
see you at the party, richter
don't touch that!
get away! get back!
what are you afraid of?
 turn it on.  impossible!
once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the terbinium in the planet.
mars will go into global meltdown.
that's why the aliens never turned it on.
and you expect me to believe you?
who gives a shit what you believe? in 30 seconds you'll be dead.
then i'll blow this place up and be home in time for corn flakes.
i didn't want it to end this way.
i wanted hauser back. but no.
you had to be quaid!
 i am quaid.  you're nothing!
you're nobody! you're a stupid dream.
well, all dreams come to an end.
melina, hold on!
don't do it!
we'll all die!
everybody will die!
quaid!
i can't believe it. it's like a dream.
what's wrong?
i just had a terrible thought. what if this is a dream?
well, then kiss me quick before you wake up.

honey, i'm home.
 roger that.
copy at the boathouse.
right on time.
faisil, get your butt in here.
harry's inside.
yeah, yeah, i'm coming.
i'm coming.
 hey, were you born in a barn?
 whorehouse.
all right. you got
your fur-coated razor blade there...
and a bunch of guys with guns.
i'm switching to subvocal now.
check, check.
 check, check.
 it's talk radio.
 you're on the air
 check.
that guard nearest to you
is moving away.
he's at the service door
he's inside.
have you seen khaled yet?
yep, there he is.
how come billionaires
are always short?
excuse me.
thank you.
colonel! how are you?
 it's so good to see you again.
 yes, it's been a long time.
 terrific.
 who was that guy?
could you hold this
for a second? thanks.
you should be crossing the main foyer,
heading for the stairs.
keep moving. keep moving.
i'm in the library, heading out
to the second-floor balcony.
modem in place.
transmitting now.
affirmatory.
it's a good hookup.
these are encrypted files.
it's going to take me a few minutes.
i got your password.
 magnificent, isn't it?
 yes, quite.
i thought i knew khaled's friends,
but i don't believe i've met you before.
we haven't met,
because i certainly would remember
renquist, harry renquist.
 juno skinner
 juno skinner
come on!
juno skinner,
arts and antiquities dealer..
specializing in ancient persia.
this is persian,
if i'm not mistaken.
very good.
sixth century bc, to be exact.
 do you like the period?
 i adore it.
we got a problem.
guards are going apeshit down there.
acquired most of these pieces
for jamal.
do you tango?
tango?
harry, you do not have time
to tango, buddy.
you copy?
don't be stopping to smell
the roses now. you hear me?
 you gotta get out of there.
 yes! files are unlocked!
fast faisil strikes again.
i'm in. i'm down, baby.
i got my hand up her dress,
and i am going for the gold...
just copy the goddamn files, okay?
wow. and i thought
this was just gonna be...
another bunch of boring bankers
and oil billionaires.
seconds count.
ditch the bitch.
unfortunately, i have to leave.
i have a plane to catch.
well, call me sometime.
my offices are in rome.
i would like that.
son of a bitch is with her two minutes,
and she's ready to bear his children.
twinkletoes,
what's your exit strategy?
i'm going to walk
right out of the front gate.
ballsy. stupid, but ballsy.
sir, may i see
your invitation, please?
sure. here is my invitation.
shit. here we go.
slight change in plans.
stay!
we're en route to
the lower rendezvous point.
repeat, backup rendezvous point!
 watch it!
 it's called ice, and it's slick.
 harry, do you copy? whoa!
 i got it.
shit!
whoops!
oh, my god!
whoa! i got it!
i got it! i got it!
 there he is!
 shit!
hi, guys.
that worked good.
right out the old front gate.
can you lean back a second?
let's go.
we can still make our flight.
all right, that's it
for mr renquist. okay, go.
we got harry tasker billfold,
harry tasker passport, ticket stub.
hotel bill, tasker
i got two postcards here from geneva.
got some house keys right there...
and i've got a souvenir
swiss snowing village.
 what's that for?
 it's for dana, stupe.
bring your kid home a gift,
the dad thing.
nice touch.
 pick me up tomorrow at 8:00.
 will do.
the debriefing is at 1000.
 see you at 8:00. bye.
 hey, harry.
did you forget something?
what a team.
sleep fast, buddy.
hi, honey. how was your flight?
 it was fine.
 good.
brought you a little gift
from switzerland. snowy village.
wow. thanks, dad.
 i've never had one of these.
 you're welcome.
you're late for school.
you better get going.
 don't forget to feed gizmo.
 okay.
it's pretty lame.
 i'm late.
 yeah, me too.
how'd it go at the convention?
make all the other salesmen jealous?
it was fantastic.
you wouldn't believe it.
you should have been there.
we were the big hit of the show.
with that new model ordering system,
the 680 i told you about...
i can write up an order
and immediately...
as soon as the customer's name comes up,
you see what his credit line is...
what he has ordered in the past,
what discount he has gotten.
 every little detail.
 sounds great.
it's fantastic. that's why
i love the computer business.
listen, the plumber called.
he says he has to dig under the slab
or something that's gonna cost $600.
 that's okay.
 it's not okay. it's extortion.
what did you tell him?
i slept with him and
he said he'd knock off $ 100.
that's good thinking.
bye, honey.
hello!
boy, i remember the first time
i got shot out of a cannon.
 good morning. go to school.
 yeah, i am.
thanks, dear
check these out.
check them out.
where's the image coming from?
got a ccd camera and a transmitter
in a pack of smokes out there.
it's pretty cool, huh?
what the hell?
bye, dad!
 she's ripping you off.
 i knew it.
let's go!
can't stop! i'm late! bye, dad!
god. shit.
kids. ten seconds of joy,
i got married three times, but at least
i was never dumb enough to have any.
she shouldn't be stealing.
i taught her better than that.
you're not her parents any more,
you and helen.
her parents are
axl rose and madonna.
five minutes a day you spend with her
can't compete with that bombardment.
you're outgunned, daddyo.
it's not just
because you're a bad parent.
kids today are ten years ahead
of where we were at the same age.
 morning.
 morning, mr tasker
 i bet you think she's still a virgin.
 don't be ridiculous.
 she's only... what is she now?
 she's 14.
 she's only 14.
 her hormones are going like an alarm.
it's even money she lets that physicist
on the bike boink her
 not dana.
 not dana.
denial. it's not just a river
in egypt no more, is it?
she's probably stealing the money
to pay for an abortion.
why don't you open the door?
or drugs.
twenty here, 50 there. i figured
my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
he takes everything else. there's
never a beer in the goddamn fridge.
 thought you moved out.
 i had to move back in.
my lawyer said it'd give me
a better shot at getting the house...
during the property settlement,
but don't change the subject.
 you still owe me 200 bucks.
 good morning, janice.
 good morning.
 identify yourselves to the scanner.
 harry tasker, 10024.
 albert gibson, 34991.
all right, frances. i don't believe
we need you any longer now. thank you.
sweet jesus. you sure screwed
the pooch last night, didn't you?
would you please tell me how i can see
this as anything but a total disaster?
total is a strong word.
there are different
degrees of totality.
it's a scale, really, with
a perfect mission on one end...
and then a total pooch screw
on the other, and we're more on this...
faisil, you're new on harry's team,
aren't you?
yes.
so what makes you think the slack
i cut him in any way translates to you?
let me show you what we got.
jamal khaled. we think he's dirty,
so we raid his private financial files.
one hundred million in wire transfers
from the commerce bank international.
which is a front for certain countries
to finance terrorist activities.
that's why we think
something really big is going down.
we know that a week ago
four mirv warheads were smuggled...
out of the former
soviet republic of kazakhstan.
we think khaled's group bought the nukes
and is trying to bring them to us soil.
so far this is not
blowing my skirt up, gentlemen.
don't you have anything
remotely substantial?
harry, do you have any hard data?
 nothing you would call rockhard.
 actually it's pretty limp, sir
then perhaps you better get some...
before somebody parks an automobile
in front of the white house...
with a nuclear weapon in the trunk.
it's not like
he's saving the world or anything.
he's a sales rep, for christ's sake.
whenever i can't sleep,
i ask him to tell me about his day.
six seconds and i'm out.
he acts like he's curing cancer
or something.
i guess this means you didn't
get away for the weekend after all.
 harry had to go out of town.
 i'm shocked.
yeah, well, you know harry.
 what's up?
 check this out.
there's a $2 million disbursement
from khaled to juno skinner
that's right.
the babe at the party.
that doesn't mean anything.
she buys antiquities for khaled.
he keeps his antique buys
on a completely separate ledger
this is a little above market rate
for the horizontal bop...
even for a total biscuit
like her
i want a complete workup on her
 do we know where she is?
 right here in river city.
she lives in rome, but she does stuff
for the smithsonian.
she has a lot of diplomatic connections,
so she has offices here.
i guess it's time
to send in a specialist.
 care to tango?
 yes, i would.
assholes.
it's all set up. you got a fax machine,
ghost phones, all the usual stuff.
you have a suite at the marquis hotel
under the name of renquist.
reality check. let's go.
my name is harry renquist. i own
an art consulting firm in san francisco.
i have an appointment
with miss skinner
 harry!
 hello.
hello.
i thought i'd see you again.
i just didn't know it would be so soon.
 what's the point of waiting?
 i agree.
your clients are looking for something
for the lobby of their new headquarters?
they would like to see something
very dramatic.
that's a nice piece.
i talked to a number of people,
and they all said you're the one to see.
really? checking on me.
so what did these people
say about me exactly?
that you can read ancient sanskrit
without having to sound out the words...
and other art dealers and archaeologists
don't like you very much.
those wimps.
it's because i use my diplomatic
contacts to export cultural treasures...
from countries which tell them
to take a hike.
most of our pieces
come from ancient persia.
unfortunately, ancient persia is 20 feet
under the sand of iran, iraq and syria.
not the most popular places
lately.
so i've had to become an expert
in international diplomacy.
well, mr renquist?
do you see anything you like?
maybe.
give me a break. i don't think
they bugged my tuna sandwich.
she's importing stuff
from all over the mideast.
she could be moving
money, guns, anything.
the second you left, we started
getting calls to the ghost numbers.
they were checking out
the renquist front.
let's step up the surveillance
and put on two more guys.
maurizio, i said saturday,
not tuesday. saturday.
miss skinner, may i have
a word with you, please?
stupid, undisciplined bitch.
it's a good thing
you're paying me a lot of money.
do you realize there are surveillance
teams watching this place right now?
your telephones are
almost certainly tapped.
and you were busy laughing and flirting
like a whore with this renquist...
he checked out okay...
we do not tolerate mistakes.
what would you like me to do?
find out where this renquist is.
hello, tektel systems.
mr tasker's office.
hi, charlene? hi, it's helen.
is he in?
harry's in a sales meeting, mrs tasker
let me try him in there. hold, please.
relay, 10024.
it's a patch from tektel.
it's helen.
hello, honey. how are you?
what's going on?
hi. i'm sorry to bother you
in the middle of a meeting.
it's just that dana and i want to make
sure you were gonna be home by 8:00.
we're going to a lot of trouble
for your big birthday.
we just wanted to make sure
that you were gonna be home.
absolutely.
this time you can count on me.
 promise?
 trust me.
 great.
 got to go. bye.
bye.
 that's disgusting, dana.
 calm down.
we got a friend.
three cars back on the inside lane.
they've been on us
since we left the hotel.
 you mean the station wagon?
 yes.
 you want me to lose them?
 no. we need this lead.
unit seven?
seven here.
we need you at the georgetown mall
in three minutes.
 copy. we're rolling.
 helen's gonna be pissed.
this is the problem with terrorists.
they're really inconsiderate
when it comes to people's schedules.
pull over here. this is good.
 okay, testing, one, two, three.
 i got you. i got you. i got you.
they're right with us.
i make three of them in the car
 dickhead.
 blow me.
i got a couple of them getting out
of the car and coming after you.
think i'm blind?
you do look like ray charles.
so what's the plan?
just trying to get a closer look
at beavis and butthead.
 there's a third one still in the car
 stay on him.
hi, helen. yeah, it's gib.
oh, not much.
listen, harry forgot something
back at the office.
you know harry.
yeah, gib, i know harry. bye.
bye. see you soon.
see?
i lost the third guy.
shit!
shit! hold it! shit!
here. cool off.
sorry about this.
look out! get out of the way!
hey! freeze!
oh, thank god.
get in the car
here we go.
federal officer
in pursuit of suspect.
sorry.
 harry, what's your 20?
 westbound in the park.
suspect is on a motorcycle,
and he's coming out on franklin.
copy!
i want you on 14th
in case he turns south.
i want seven on the north side
to box him in.
make it quick, because
my horse is getting tired.
your horse?
 there he is! that's him!
 come on!
 go around to the back.
 copy that.
out of my way!
out of my way!
sorry.
excuse me.
 jesus!
 sorry.
open it!
excuse me. excuse me.
out of the way!
move! move! move!
federal officer! get down! now!
get off or die!
 get down! now!
 move!
turn around! hold still!
come on!
whoa!
hold still!
will you press the button
for the top floor, please?
thank you.
help!
shut up!
whoa.
say something.
that's a fine animal.
stay against the glass!
come on.
so sorry.
stay there! don't move!
come on, come on, come on!
okay, back up.
back up.
you can do it.
come on.
good horse. good.
yeah, yeah. yeah, go back now.
come on.
yeah, that's teamwork now.
keep pulling. come on.
a little bit more.
that a boy.
okay.
what the hell were you thinking?
i had the guy,
and you let him get away.
look at me when i talk to you.
what kind of a cop are you anyway?
hi, honey.
i know you're upset.
i'm sorry.
i hurried home
as fast as i could.
it's okay.
it's okay.
i'm sorry.
thank you for the party.
yeah, it was great.
hey.
that's him.
 pause it right there.
 salim abu aziz.
this guy is really hardcore.
highly fanatical.
the man's a real psycho. he's been
linked to dozens of car bombings.
you know that cafe bomb
in rome last year? that was his.
as well as a 727 out of lisbon.
this guy's a major player
now he's formed his own splinter faction
called crimson jihad.
i guess he thought the other terrorists
were too warm and fuzzy for him.
 they call him the sand spider
 why?
probably because it sounds scary.
this is impressive, gentlemen.
it would be even more impressive
if you actually knew where he was.
we'll get him.
 why don't you pull over here?
 what's up?
i really screwed up
with helen last night.
i'm going to see if she's available
for lunch to smooth things over
 you just want me to hang?
 just hang.
i'll just be hanging.
hold, please.
 it's your mystery man on two.
 simon?
oh, my god.
hello? simon?
simon?
yes, i can talk.
you mean right now?
yes, i can meet you.
okay, i can't wait.
bye.
can you cover me for an hour?
just an hour? you should tell
that stud to take more time.
would you shut up?
i should have never told you about him.
have a good time.
get a little bit for me
while you're at it.
hey! hold it! fucker!
what's going on? sick?
looks like you got gutkicked.
it's hel... it's helen...
it's helen.
it has something to do with helen,
i'm guessing.
helen...
is having an affair
welcome to the club, man.
it can't be. not helen.
nobody thinks it could happen to them
the first time.
same thing happened to me
with wife number two, remember?
i had no idea nothing was going on.
i come home, and the house is empty.
she even took the ice cube trays
out of the freezer
what kind of a sick bitch takes
the ice cube trays out of the freezer?
 it's not helen.
 helen still loves you.
she just wants to bang this guy
for a while. it's nothing serious.
 you'll get used to it soon...
 stop cheering me up!
what'd you expect?
helen's a flesh-and-blood woman,
and you're never there.
it was just a matter of time.
i say we concentrate on work.
that's what i do every time
my life turns to dog shit.
i concentrate on work,
and that gets me by.
right, buddy?
it's gonna be great.
we're gonna catch some terrorists.
we're gonna beat the crap out of them.
you're going to feel a hell
of a lot better
watch your head.
okay. all right.
women. can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em.
i came by your office today.
i was in the area, and i thought
you might want to have lunch.
really? well,
you must have just missed me.
that's what they said. they said
you had to run out or something.
it was this rush job...
they needed these documents
down at the district courthouse.
so, of course, the big problem...
our printer shut down.
so i went to the third floor
to use theirs, but they have the 1720.
of course, the disk
isn't formatted for the 1720.
so i had to go back upstairs
and reformat...
go back downstairs
and use their printer
by the time i got there,
i couldn't get my car to start.
then traffic...
i barely got there.
so a little excitement
in an otherwise dull day.
did it work out okay?
yeah. great.
i'll check on dessert.
i'm done.
the great thing is that he's practically
given us a blank cheque on wiretaps.
i set them up on all of juno's
shipping agents and her clients.
faisil's made a list
of all the possible contacts...
the crimson jihad
may have in this country.
now all we have
to do is sit around...
hey. this national security stuff
boring you?
 put a tap on her phone.
 what? i already did that.
i'm talking about helen's. put a tap
on her office line and the house. now.
come over here for a second.
that sounds great.
i want to ask you about something.
i got two words to describe that idea...
insane. an unauthorized wiretap's
a felony. you know that.
and you're doing it 20 times a day,
so don't give me that crap.
do it.
 hello?
 helen, it's simon. is it safe to talk?
yes, go ahead.
i can't talk long. can you meet me
for lunch tomorrow? i must see you.
i suppose so. where?
same place, 1:00.
i have to go now. see you tomorrow.
remember, i need you.
i thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.
you know... darn it...
i'm going to meet allison.
we're going to go shopping. sorry.
no problem.
i think you're going about
this whole thing all wrong.
women... they like you
to talk to them.
maybe it's just that you're not
in touch with your feminine side.
i was watching sally jessy raphael...
all right.
i got all the usual stuff here...
a telemetry burst transmitter
i got a gps tracker, an audio
transmitter and a power supply.
i've got it sewn into the lining here...
hey, harry?
if you need to talk,
speak into the purse.
here she comes. she's gonna pop out
right in front of us. watch this.
bingo.
looks like she's going
into chinatown.
she's parking.
okay, give me audio.
you sure you weren't followed?
no. i kept looking behind me like
you taught me, but i didn't see anyone.
okay, it's just that things
are a bit hot right now.
if i get a signal,
i may have to leave suddenly.
i understand.
look, it's my job to take risks,
but not yours.
i feel bad about bringing you into this,
but you're the only one i can trust.
were you out on a mission?
we say op, covert operation.
and this one, well, got a little rough.
 worse than cairo?
 cairo.
cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.
 the guy's a spook.
 but for whom?
he could be working her
to get to you.
 did you read the papers yesterday?
 yes.
sometimes a story is a mask
for a covert operation.
you see two men killed in a restroom
and two unidentified men...
in a running shootout,
ending at the marriott?
that was you?
 me.
 you're very good.
you recognized my style.
you're a natural at this.
the guy's a fake.
he's taking credit for our moves.
 what happened?
 hardly worth talking about.
two of them
won't bother me again.
 unbelievable.
 you chased one?
something came over me. i had to nail
this guy no matter what the risk.
pretty hairy. i thought
he had me a couple of times, but i...
 i really can't take credit.
 why not?
it's the training. it shapes you
into a lethal instrument.
you react in a microsecond
without thinking.
i'm starting to like this guy.
we still gotta kill him.
that's a given, you know.
the guy is a goddamned
used car salesman.
this keeps getting better and better!
i'm sorry.
i know this has gotta be painful.
but you gotta admit it's funny.
if it was just some idiot, not you...
you'd be laughing your ass off.
one born every minute.
it wants you too.
feel it vibrate?
 say, how about a little spin?
 sure.
see, it's not just a car
it's a total image. an identity.
you have to go for it.
this isn't some hightech sports car
to tell you the truth,
it doesn't even handle that great.
but that's not the idea, is it?
what are we talking about here?
pussy, right?
absolutely.
let's face it.
the 'vette gets 'em wet.
but it's not enough.
if you really want to close escrow,
you gotta have an angle.
i suppose you have an angle.
it's killer
i mean, look at me.
i'm not that much to look at.
no, no, no.
i can be honest.
but i got 'em lining up,
and not just the skanks either
 well, some are.
 what's your angle?
no, sorry. trade secret.
okay, just ask yourself:
what do women really want?
you take these bored housewives
married to the same guy for years.
they're stuck in a rut.
they need some release.
the promise of adventure,
a hint of danger
i create that for them.
so basically you're lying
your ass off the whole time.
 i couldn't do that.
 what are you, a boy scout?
think of it as playing a role.
it's fantasy.
you gotta work on their dreams...
get them out of their daily
suburban grind for a few hours.
 what about their husbands?
 dickless!
i mean, let's face it.
if they took care of business...
i'd be out of business,
you know what i mean?
those idiots.
you mind keeping it under 90?
i'm still trying
to pay for this dental work.
so, who are you
working on right now?
i always got a couple on the hook.
there's this one right now,
i got her panting like a dog.
 it's great.
 what does she do?
some sort of legal secretary
or something.
you know,
uptight and conservative.
but she could be so hot
if she wanted to be.
and with you,
she gets to be real hot.
red hot!
her thighs steam.
it's like a dying plant.
just needs a little water
 married to some boring jerk.
 some boring jerk?
he doesn't appreciate her
she's like all these babes.
you get their pilot lit,
they can suck-start a leaf-blower
she's got the most incredible body,
and a pair of titties...
make you want to stand up
and beg for buttermilk.
ass like a ten-year-old boy.
so, then she must be
really good in bed then, huh?
slow down.
you'll miss the turn.
see?
you and this car were made
for each other why fight it?
sure, i got a couple other buyers
on the line, but i like your style.
so, what do you say?
should we start up
the paperwork?
let me think about it.
hold it for me for a day, okay?
hey, because it's you.
i got today's transcripts.
not much going on.
 nothing from simon?
 no.
 my turn to drive?
 give me the page.
 what?
 this jumped from page 9 to 11.
 where's page 10?
 it's gotta be a typo.
give me the goddamn page!
 seek help, harry.
 hello?
helen, i need your help.
can you meet me tonight?
 what's happened?
 it's serious.
meet me on k street...
under the key bridge,
gotcha.
shit. it's almost 8:00.
she's still at the house.
the purse is still at the house.
shit.
unit two, unit seven,
immediate roll.
acquire subject
at k street and key bridge.
vehicle is red and white convertible.
you got exactly six minutes.
wait a minute.
are you out of your mind?
you can't pull agents off a priority
surveillance to follow your wife.
that's a misappropriation of resources
and a breach of national security.
you copy?
you're losing it big-time, man.
 i have to stop you.
 what are you gonna do, tell?
look, goddamn it.
both of our butts are on the line.
so your life's in the crapper
your wife's banging a used car salesman.
it's humiliating, i know,
but take it like a man!
 you tell on me, i tell on you.
 what are you talking about?
i'm as clean as a preacher's sheets.
i'm as clean as...
what about when you blew
a six-week operation...
because you were busy
getting a blowjob?
you knew about that?
let's take franklin.
it's quicker
quick, get in.
hurry up. let's go.
two here.
suspect vehicle in sight.
one male, one female.
now, don't be alarmed.
if i'm spotted, it'd be best
if they didn't see you.
you should keep your head down
till we're out of the city.
here, let me help you.
that's better
now the woman has her head
in the guy's lap.
southbound on the key bridge.
two in pursuit.
roger, two.
one to condor, you got a visual?
roger, one. this is condor
subject is in sight.
repeat: we have the ball.
we got a pretty good lockup
on infrared.
she's got her head
in the guy's lap, all right.
maybe she's sleepy.
this is a safe house.
my place in the city
is a little too hot right now.
so is the penthouse in new york.
what is it exactly
you need me to do?
i want you to be my wife.
but i'm married!
it's just for the operation in paris.
i need to be married.
they'll be looking for a man
traveling alone.
you want me to go to paris?
paris, with a quick stopover
in london.
there's a double agent in my outfit.
i don't know who.
there's no one i can trust,
except you.
can you get away,
just for a couple of days?
i just don't know.
of course. i'm rushing you.
forgive me.
sit down.
make yourself comfortable.
let me pour you some more wine.
i'll do it.
i'll do it.
you just saved my life.
you are incredibly brave.
i have to remind myself
of the fear you must be feeling.
you see, for me
fear is not an option.
now, in order to pull
this cover story off...
we have to look like two people who are
completely intimate with each other
the enemy can spot a fake easily.
 you see what i mean?
 sorry.
that reaction could
get us both killed.
 i'm sorry.
 we can't afford that.
try to relax.
it's just been a long time...
since anybody but harry's
touched me like that.
 it's a little difficult.
 i know.
 it's awkward for me too.
 i'm sorry.
 that's all right. just sit back.
 i'm okay.
there. that's better
just let yourself
slip into the role.
that's it.
there you go.
just let yourself go.
that's good.
that's great.
that's it.
no, i can't do this.
i can't do this.
 what's wrong? it's okay.
 i cannot do this.
i cannot do this!
if not for me...
do it for your country?
oh, god!
don't hurt me!
i'll do whatever you want!
please!
i didn't do anything!
damn it!
take her! take her!
oh, god, don't hurt me!
son of a bitch!
sit down.
i said sit down.
who do you work for?
stern, kessler,
goldstein & krumpnick.
 i'm just a legal secretary.
 sure, mrs tasker
what were you doing
with the international terrorist...
carlos the jackal,
taking dictation?
how long have you been
a member of his faction?
i don't know anything
about a faction.
i just met simon...
or whoever you say he is...
just a couple weeks ago.
i barely know him.
that's not what it looked like
when we found you.
how did you meet him?
well...
keep this for me.
i can't afford to be taken with it.
 what?
 it's a matter of national security.
please, it's important.
i'll contact you.
oh, shit.
why did you continue
to see him?
he said he needed my help.
not because you were
attracted to him?
you were not attracted
to him at all?
well, maybe just a little.
 so, is cheating a common thing for you?
 never
so you're telling me
this was your first time?
i wasn't cheating!
tell me about your husband,
mrs tasker.
what can i say about harry?
he's a sales rep
for a computer company.
so sex with him isn't exactly
waving your flag any more?
that is none of your goddamn business!
what kind of questions are these?
you're in a lot of trouble,
so i suggest you cooperate.
if we want to know the most
intimate details about your life...
you'd better tell us.
my husband is a good man.
but he's not exactly ringing
your bell these days, is he?
let me handle this part.
do you mind?
why did you go
to carlos' hideout?
he wanted me to go to paris with him
on a mission...
to pose as his wife.
and you agreed?
why?
i don't know.
i guess i needed something.
what did you need?
i needed to feel alive.
i just wanted to do
something outrageous.
and it felt really good...
to be needed.
and to be trusted.
and to be special.
it's just that there's...
so much i wanted to do
with this life...
and it's like
i haven't done any of it.
and the sand's running out
of the hourglass...
and i wanted to be able
to look back and say...
see? i did that!
i was reckless and i was wild
and i fucking did it!
quite frankly,
i don't give a shit...
whether you understand that or not.
this simon...
did you sleep with him?
 no.
 she's lying.
you did not have
sexual relations with him?
listen, if you're gonna ask me
every question twice...
this is gonna take a really long time,
and i have to get back to my family.
you're not going anywhere, lady.
just let me out of here!
answer the question.
 answer the question!
 no!
i did not...
sleep with him!
calm down, please.
you hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?
 calm down.
 she could be telling the truth.
calm down, mrs tasker
calm down, please.
i've only one more question,
mrs tasker
what?
do you still love your husband?
yes, i love him.
i've always loved him...
and i will always love him.
she loves you.
now what?
there's only one solution
to your problem, mrs tasker
you must work for us.
what are you doing?
 just giving her a little assignment.
 you gotta be shitting me!
she wants a little adventure,
so i'm gonna give her one.
i'm offering you a choice.
if you work for us,
we will drop the charges...
and you can go back
to your normal life.
if not, you will go
to a federal prison...
and your husband and daughter
will be left humiliated and alone.
your life will be destroyed.
gee. let me think.
yes or no?
of course yes.
what's involved?
you will be contacted
with the assignment.
the code name of your contact
will be boris.
your code name will be...
 natasha?
 no.
doris.
pricks!
you son of a bitch. did you think
you could elude us forever, carlos?
wait! you got the wrong guy.
my name's simon.
just let me go.
there's no need to kill me.
i haven't seen your face...
don't! i didn't see it!
i didn't see it!
it's you!
hey, you still interested
in that 'vette at all?
hey, carlos.
the game's over
your career as an international
terrorist is well documented.
 no!
 oh, yeah!
i sell cars.
that's all!
come on.
i'm not a terrorist.
i'm actually a complete coward.
if i ever saw a gun i'd... oh, god!
oh, please, don't!
don't kill me!
i'm not a spy.
i'm nothing!
i'm navel lint!
i have to lie to women to get laid.
and i don't score much.
i got a little dick.
it's pathetic.
oh, god.
would a spy pee himself?
huh?
please, i'm not worth a bullet.
 have mercy, sir
 get the fuck out of here.
just beat it.
go on.
as soon as i turn,
you're gonna shoot me!
you're gonna shoot me!
please! you can have
the car for free.
what do you say, huh?
get lost, dipshit.
so last night must've been
pretty exciting for you.
my flat tyre?
actually, it was a little scary...
because the tow truck driver
took such a long time.
i'll get it.
hello?
doris?
yes?
listen carefully.
in exactly one hour,
go to the hotel marquis.
pick up an envelope marked doris
at the front desk...
 and dress sexy.
 what?
no, no.
turn around.
do it doucement.
do it very slowly.
you've reached a new
all-time low.
i can't believe you're crazy enough
to use the suite at the marquis.
do you think i can afford
a suite like this on my salary?
 is jean-claude done yet?
 hang on.
who wrote this shit? harry?
it's going great.
do you have an envelope for doris?
this is doris.
listen, you are
a prostitute named michelle.
go to the room.
there will be a man there.
he is a suspected arms dealer
now, wait a minute.
you don't expect me to, uh,
you know.
no. he has particular tastes.
he likes to watch.
tell him that his regular girl,
carla, is sick.
if he likes you,
he will tell you what to do.
you must plant the bug...
near the telephone by the bed
before you leave.
if you do not
complete your mission...
the deal is off.
i'm gonna go to hell.
have some champagne.
come in here.
my name is michelle.
carla thought you'd like me.
let me do the talking.
you may start by
unzipping your dress.
no, no. turn around.
do it doucement.
do it very slowly.
good.
now slip the dress down slowly.
good.
now slide your nylons off
one by one.
i'm not wearing any.
that's good.
now, dance for me.
dance sexy.
let your hands be your lover's hands
on your own skin as you move.
now lie on the bed
and close your eyes.
i thought you only
liked to watch.
now lie on the bed
and close your eyes.
you pig!
bastard!
wait, wait, wait.
yes, it's harry. i know it looks bad,
but i can explain.
nobody move!
don't move!
helen, just don't do anything.
no, he has nothing to do with it!
i'm the one you want!
shut up!
quiet, helen.
do what they say.
come on, guys, let the hooker go.
she's not important.
you don't need her
harry, please,
just let me handle this.
shut up!
what were you doing there?
 you wouldn't believe me if i told you.
 talk again and i'll kill you!
i wish i could say
it's nice to see you again.
you know her?
you know, this shade's
totally wrong for you.
so who's your little friend?
i'm helen tasker
harry is my husband. and you are?
so now it's tasker,
not renquist.
she's just some wacko hooker
i met down at the bar
what is the matter with you?
just tell her the truth!
we are married,
and we have a daughter
i don't know what
the crazy bitch is on.
you should cut her loose
so we can get down to business.
where did i get this then, huh?
where did i get this?
something before takeoff?
that hurt, you b...
she was telling the truth,
wasn't she?
she really doesn't know.
how interesting.
bring them.
incredible, aren't they?
i call them the four horsemen.
they're warrior figures...
from the persian empire
of darius i...
around 500 bc.
they're absolutely priceless.
pity.
wait, wait!
open it.
do you know what this is?
i know what this is.
this is an espresso machine.
it's a snow cone maker
that's what it is.
is it a water heater?
do you know why
you've been brought here?
so that this man
can verify to the world...
the crimson jihad
is now a nuclear power
how can he do that?
he's just a salesman, for christ's sake.
if i'm wrong about him,
the last thing you'll see...
will be your blood
spraying across his face.
it's a soviet mirv6
from an ss22 air launch vehicle.
the warhead contains
and a plutonium trigger
the nominal yield is 30 kilotons.
what can i say?
i'm a spy.
you bastard!
you lying son of a bitch!
 sorry, honey.
 don't you call me honey!
you don't ever get
to call me honey again!
you understand me, you pig?
and i can verify that
they have the arming box...
and all the equipment necessary...
to detonate all four warheads.
you have killed our women
and our children...
bombed our cities from afar
like cowards...
and you dare
to call us terrorists?
now the oppressed
have been given a mighty sword...
with which to strike back
at their enemies.
unless you, america...
pulls all military forces
out of the persian gulf area...
immediately and forever..
the crimson jihad will rain fire...
on one major u.s. city each week...
until our demands are met.
first, we will detonate one weapon
on this uninhabited island...
as a demonstration of our power..
and crimson jihad's willingness
to be humanitarian.
however, if these demands
are not met...
crimson jihad will rain fire...
on one major american city
each week...
battery.
get another one, you moron.
i think i have one in the truck.
 what?
 look at this.
 that's not mine.
 nice transmitter
miami tower,
jet star 6479 delta on final.
 we'll be on the ground in 12 minutes.
 all right.
tell those d.e.a. boys
to have the helos...
hot and ready to fly
in 12 minutes.
signal's definitely stopped moving.
it's an island in the keys.
 we lost the signal.
 shit!
all right, everyone.
this is samir
for 50 points,
see if you can guess his specialty.
oral hygiene?
 not exactly.
 what's going on?
samir's just gonna ask harry
a few questions.
we're not even sure
which agency harry works for
now, samir's absolutely firstclass.
on the other hand we have harry,
who's managed to lie convincingly...
to the woman he loves for 15 years.
so it'll be interesting to see
how long he can resist.
this will help.
you know, you should
swab that with alcohol.
i might get an infection.
i'll return when
this has taken effect.
then we'll talk.
i'm looking forward to it.
now, why are you helping
these raving psychotics?
because they're very well-funded
raving psychotics...
and i'm getting a lot of money.
what, you think i care
about their cause?
or yours?
not at all.
you're damaged goods, lady.
did you tell her about us?
there is no us,
you psychopathic bitch.
oh, sure.
you say that now.
thanks for everything.
it wasn't bad while it lasted.
let's go.
you two stay here.
there was nothing.
i swear
what did they give you?
sodium amytal,
or some other truth agent.
it makes you tell the truth?
is it working?
ask me a question
that i normally would lie to.
 are we gonna die?
 yep.
i'd say it's working.
they're gonna shoot us in the head,
or they're gonna torture us to death...
or they're gonna leave us here
and let the bomb...
how long have you been a spy?
seventeen years.
have you ever killed anyone?
yeah, but they were all bad.
is there anything you want to tell me
before we start?
yeah.
i'm going to kill you pretty soon.
i see.
how, exactly?
first, i'm going to use you
as a human shield.
then i'm going to kill
this guard over there...
with the patterson trocar
on the table.
and then i was thinking
about breaking your neck.
and what makes you think
you can do all that?
you know my handcuffs?
i picked them.
let's get out of here.
come on!
drop the gun!
honey, next time, duck.
 let's go.
 i married rambo.
what are they doing?
it is done.
in 90 minutes,
a pillar of holy fire...
will light up the skies...
to show to the world...
that we speak the truth.
we are set on our course.
no force can stop us now.
we're cool, we're badasses,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
if we're on an island,
why are they using trucks?
we must be in the florida keys.
the overseas highway connects
the islands to the mainland.
there's no borders, no customs.
they can go anywhere in the u.s.
there's nothing to stop them.
just us.
 here, take this.
 oh, shit.
shoot!
shit!
let's go.
my condolences to the widow.
we may need the hostage.
okay, let's go, suzy homemaker
hurry up!
just get her in the car
let's get going.
 i thought this looked like your work.
 let's go. i'll brief you in the air
you're welcome. let's go!
let's get out of here!
let's go!
come on!
well, you tell that son of a bitch
this is a bright boy alert.
i repeat:
a bright boy alert.
this is not a drill.
do you understand that?
hold on.
put me through to the white house.
the minimum safe distance is 12 miles.
get the marine patrol in right away.
i want the coast guard
and the sheriff's department too.
anyone that cannot make that distance,
you gotta get 'em out by air

i can get you two marine corps harriers
here in 11 minutes.
 they're on manoeuvres outside key west.

i want the state police driving through
the streets on their damn loudspeakers.

aziz's copter landed about 20 minutes
ago on top of a highrise in miami.
he rendezvoused with some faction
members. they're on the 20th floor
i got swat down there.
the cops cordoned off the area.
they got a hostage.
it's dana.
what do you mean?
my dana?
i'm real sorry.
i don't know what to say.
i guess he grabbed her
in the middle of the night.
we just found out about it.
but i don't want you to worry.
we'll get her back.
i've got a guy on the inside.
listen.
we're gonna get her back.
here we go.
excuse me, captain. i got to
borrow your plane for a minute.
listen, force comm cleared you
to give us total cooperation, right?
and you know that comes directly from
the president of these united states.
but, sir, you're gonna have
to sign for this aircraft.
i'll sign for it. you got a pen?
you take care of it.
do you realize
it has been ten years...
since you've been behind
the wheel of one of these?
i break it,
they can take it out of my pay.
listen, we got a guy on the inside.
gotta move back, everybody!
let's go!
all right, everybody,
it's gonna be all right!
he's got hundreds of hours
in the harriers there.
he is a little rusty,
but that's a trademark tasker takeoff.
it's like riding a bike.
you never forget, really.
we might wanna seek shelter!
sorry.
fuck!
the streets are filled with people
as police try to evacuate the buildings.
they appear to be shooting
wildly into the air as i'm speaking.
these seem to be warning shots.
so far..
they have not fired at us or police.
this apparently is the same group...
which just detonated a nuclear bomb
in the florida keys.
crimson jihad will rain fire
on one major u.s. city each week...
until our demands are met.
this tape was released to the media
just minutes after the terrorists...
i have to go to the bathroom.
we'll repeat the tape following
this live report from the scene.
hold your fire!
 the video crew you wanted is here!
 send them!
they're coming in.
they're unarmed.
come on. let's go.

from crimson jihad.

of our power

to destroy this city...
and do not try
to use force against us.

hi, pumpkin.
just seconds after thejet landed...
the unidentified pilot was escorted
from the scene by federal agents.
though it is unclear at this moment
which agency was responsible...
for the operation which ended
the terrorist threat...
so dramatically
early this morning...
we've learned from miami police...

i been in the van for 15 years.

on his 35th birthday,
i decided to tell julius benedict...
the truth about himself.
julius already knew
that he was the product...
of a scientific experiment...
conducted by the american government.
a top secret experiment designed
to produce a physically,
mentally and spiritually
advanced human being.
he knew that,
unlike other little boys,
he had not one, but six fathers
all very distinguished men...
especially chosen for
their genetic excellence.
and of course,
he knew about mary ann benedict,
the remarkable young woman...
who was selected to be his mother
sadly, he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge...
that his mother died
while giving birth to him.
now, what julius did not know,
not until this very moment,
was that about a minute
after he was born...
his mother gave birth
to another baby boy.
i have a brother?
ya.
he was sent to an orphanage
in los angeles...
at the same time
i brought you here to the island.
julius had spent his entire life
here on the island,
helping me with my research.
i always thought he was happy,
and had no desire to leave.
how wrong i was.
i must find him.
julius, julius!
wait, wait.
i couldn't believe he was going.
he wasn't equipped to deal
with the outside world.
all of his knowledge was from books.
julius could speak 12 languages.
he excelled in history, science,
mathematics, literature.
he was pure in body and in spirit.
ahhh!
but for the first time,
julius would not listen to me.
he's probably just like me.
the nearest island with
an airport was 27 miles away.
but julius did not care.
he had become obsessed
with the idea...
that his brother, vincent,
was in some kind of trouble...
and desperately needed his help.
honey, i'm home!
 oh, no!
 oh, no.
 get going!
 i'm going.
oh, hello, hello!
oh, my goodness!
goodbye.
 we're gonna be late for work.
 i need my horoscope.
 yeah, horoscope.
 your judgment is at its peak today.
use it wisely,
and romance will follow.
 ooh, good one.
 i hope so.
ladies!
 vince!
 i thought you broke up with him.
i did, i did!
 you don't mind if i talk
to your sister, do you?
 she doesn't mind.
don't give him any money.
uh, no, no, i promised marnie
i wouldn't give you any money.
don't look at me like that.
don't do that thing
with your eyes.
i'm not even supposed
to be here with you.
you are here,
and so am i.
maybe millions
of people go by,
but they all
disappear from view.
i only have eyes
for you, linda.
i only have
eyes for you.
mmm.
 it's the baby klane!
 what?
 hi.
 hi.
 can i help you?
 uh, yeah.
where's the little shit?
you'll have to be
more specific...
concerning the clientele.
benedict.
oh, he wouldn't come in here.
 isn't that right, marnie?
 who, vincent?
that weasel? that creep?
i wouldn't serve him if he crawled in
on his hands and knees.

we're doing this
too often, vince.
i will give you something.
i got a nice bmw
up on 4, stall 20.
vince, i'll take all
of these you can get.
all right, tony.
 for you.
 thanks, tony.
yeah.
whoa, tony!
there's only $4000 here.
for a car like this is $6000.
we're in a recession.
everything's tough.
you wanna try someone else,
no hard feelings.
no, i just could've
used some more.
 you okay, vince? you seem worried.
 yeah.
your bowels troubling you?
what an amazing country.
hey.

oh, excuse me.
i don't smoke, pal.
yeah. haha.
yeah, good stuff, huh?
 pickin' up something
for the girlfriend?
 i don't have a girlfriend.
do women really
wear those things?
if you're lucky, they do.
i can't believe it.
 you're from out of town?
 yes.
as a matter of fact, i come from
an island in the south pacific.
whoa!
what the hell did
you do to him, man!
i did nothing.
the pavement was his enemy.
let me check him out.
a light concussion.
uhoh.
 i carry him to a hospital.
 no!
i think you should
just take off, man.
find your horse
you came in on.
i am so sorry about this.
 i feel terrible.
 me, too. thanks a lot.
 sorry.
 yeah, i'm sorry.
the next time you should
really consider wearing helmets.
yeah, have a nice day.
you don't have to buy them.
just don't say they're cheap!
these are quality socks.
what a day it's been.
oh, no, no, no!
oh, oh! jesus christ!
$53! are you
out of your mind?
your vehicle is in a handicapped zone,
if you didn't notice.
so, do i look
normal to you?
you don't have a handicapped
sticker in your windshield.
oh, come on.
you don't need a sticker
handicapped, my ass!
i will need your
driver's license, sir
look, i'm sorry
i lost my temper
driver's license,
please.
 look, i had a very bad day.
 driver's license... please.
you've got over 200 outstanding
parking tickets, mr benedict.
you just had your birthday.
your driver's license expired.
happy birthday.
watch your head.
thanks.
come along, now.
so this is where
my brother grew up.
i am so happy he had so many
children to play with.
and that's where
he must have slept!
yes, it was.
how did you know?
it's the one i would have chosen,
close to the fire extinguisher
in case of a fire,
i could have given the alarm
and saved all the other orphans.
we've had only one fire
in here at st. charlotte's.
vince benedict started it,
we like to think by accident.
tell me a little bit
about vincent.
was he a great athlete?
interested in chess and poetry?
i am certain god had a purpose
when he created vince benedict,
but it had nothing
to do with chess or poetry.
oh, i am sorry.
odd, the contents
of his files are missing.
that is vince?
he looks so happy.
he should.
that's sister maria,
 his biology teacher
 i always liked biology.
so did vincent.
he disgraced sister maria,
who had to leave the order
then he stole all the money from
the library fund, and ran away.
i must find my brother
do you know
where he might be?
jail, a man of his character
can only be in jail.
you're full of goodness, julius.
i pray you never find him.
benedict, visitor
 i am looking for vincent benedict.
 you got him.
i have rowed halfway
across the world
wrong, i just rowed a day
i have been looking forward to
this moment my whole life.
i have been on my island,
i am telling you.
this is incredible that
i have looked for
you've gotta talk
into the phone, bozo.
vincent.
yes, vincent...
i know you don't
know who i am.
 but believe me, i came
 whoa, whoa, whoa!
i have got another six hours
to pay the money back.
tell the klane brothers that harassing
a man already in the slammer
is beneath even them,
all right?
i don't know any klane brothers.
i am your brother, julius.
huh? come again?
my name is julius,
and i am your twin brother
oh, obviously.
the moment i sat down, i thought
i was looking into a mirror
we are not
identical twins.
 oh, no?
 no.
i wouldn't be
too sure, pal.
i don't lie.
i am your brother
you must let me help
you get out of here.
you want to
help me get out?
yes, right now.
well, money talks,
and bullshit walks.
how can bullshit walk?
that's slang, huh?
yeah.
i'm in fast company here.
take a look over there.
see that man?
pay him money, all right?
they let me out.
i will be anything you want,
your aunt, uncle, sister..
your cousin,
brother in law, anything.
 all right?
 okay, i pay right now.
 you pay now.
 okay, vince.
okay. go pay.
all right, pay him.
what is this,
candid camera?
ahhh, oof!
twinny, i hope you didn't
blow your wad on the tickets,
because i'm gonna need
a lot more money to get my car
 i have more money.
 you do?
i am glad to help you.
vincent, i am your brother
 i love you.
 whoa!
look, ease up
on the love talk,
because i'm gonna be tossing
my cookies in a minute.
tossing your cookies?
oh, that's more slang!
where the hell is it?
 this is your car, isn't it?
 yeah, that's it.
you pay a huge fine,
then they hide it on you.
 how'd you know this was my car?
 we're twins!
i am so excited. now we can
go to museums together,
talk philosophy together,
read books together
 play chess together
 get lost together
vincent!
he's so full of energy.
blue sedan deville.
this is beautiful.
where you guys going,
out to hawaii?
 catch some of them big waves?
 yeah, something like that.
we have plenty
of room on level 4.
i will call you
next saturday.
whoa, where you going
with my desk?
takin' back this
furniture, man.
 you're six months behind.
 you're behind!
six months behind.
that's the problem.
there's no trust
in the world anymore.
i tried to stop them,
mr benedict.
that's all right, it was
time to redecorate anyway.
vincent benedict incorporated.
 sports agent...
 airborne!
 mr benedict?
 yeah?
 my name is al.
 your name is al? ooh, al, al, al.

all right, all right.
al, save me!
brand new caddy on level 4.
i'll be there!
don't move! bye.
whoa!
time's up, vincent.
did you hit me?
because i didn't feel a thing.
i felt that.
you gotta understand
something, benedict.
i like my work.
these are the most unfriendly acts
you're committing.
i don't know
what the problem is,
but i am sure it
can be resolved...
 without resorting to violence.
 yeah.
okay?
okay.
 you moved too soon.
 he did?
ahhh!
a little chest pain?
the first rule
in a crisis situation:
you negotiate first
and you attack last.
you negotiate first,
then you attack.
 you never negotiated.
 nahah!
you don't know what
kind of an enemy i am.
 who are you?
 i am vincent's brother
 we're twins.
 that's right.
 you're firewood!
 axe, axe, axe!
you have no respect
for logic.
 but he's got an axe!
 ahhhh!
and i have no respect for those
who have no respect for logic.
you're a very stupid person.
you tell your brother,
he messes with me, he messes
with my whole family!
i love it when you
hit people, julius.
boom!
that was great!
actually,
i hate violence.
but you're so good at it!
i have an idea. we should
go into business together
you could be a boxer
i could be your manager
 i don't think i could fight for money.
 no problem!
you do all the fighting,
i'll keep all the money.
i am really worried
about you, vincent.
how much money
do you owe?
don't lie to me.
we're twins.
 i can feel your pain.
 why do you keep saying that?
we're not twins.
we're not brothers.
we're nothin'!
twenty thousand.
due this morning.
come on.
don't worry about
anything, vincent.
as long as i'm with you,
i won't let anyone harm you, okay?
well, you're
a good guy, julius.
now, hang on
to your seat!
you know what?
i completely forgot.
i promised this
friend, sammy,
that i would pick his car up
from the airport.
put it in the slot.
would you do me
a big favor?
would you drive this car back
from the airport for me?
oh, i would love to.
good, that would
really be a big help.
do you have a manual, please?
 a manual?
 yeah.
 it is in the glove compartment.
 oh, yeah.
there it is.
 what are you doin' with the finger?
 learning to drive.
whoa!
it is not up here.
maybe it's under
the back tire.
look... i mean, usually he
leaves the keys behind the tire.
 geez!
 what's the matter?
that dopey sam,
he forgot to leave the keys.
no. oh, well.
a lot of handicapped children
are gonna be very disappointed.
handicapped children?
this car was supposed to be auctioned
off at their charity drive tomorrow.
oh, well. let's go get
something to eat.
maybe we should try
to open it ourselves.
do you really think
we should do that?
it is for children.
you got a point.
i saw a guy from
the auto club do this once.
what do you know,
beginners luck!
these cars have
terrific alarms!
i'll get it in a minute.
just a second, jules.
whoa!
whoa, whoa, whoa!
if you lift the rear end at an angle
greater than 45 degrees...
the mercury switch activates
the automatic cutoff system,
so that the alarm's
computer thinks...
that the car is being
towed and shuts off.
can i have the keys
to your car?
you know,
the keys to your car?
yeah, yeah, yeah.
no yodeling.
lovely day.
come on, julius.
step on it!
yeeeoow!
oh, my god!
 i'm amazed at how well it's going.
 you're doing good.
don't use both feet
at the same time.
 just use the gas.
 okay, one foot.
 one pedal at a time.
 okay! i'll do it!
pick up the phone,
the phone.
the little thing down on
the right that's making noise.
this is vincent's car
can i help you, please?
 julius!
 vincent, where are you?
look in your rearview mirror
you see that little dot?
that's me.
hello, yeah. hello!
what are you
doing back there?
there's going to be a lot of
lights coming up, a supermarket.
 supermarket.
 take your foot off the gas.
apply it to the brake.
it is the thing next to the gas.
the brake pedal.
 very gently.
 you got it.
bye, vincent.
all right.
okay, it's a supermarket.
ohhh!
ohhh!
that's what i call fun.
did you see me
with the two wheels?
i can teach
you that, vincent.
julius, let me tell you
something about america.
nobody likes
a smart ass, all right?
so, what do you think?
angel's food
or devil's food?
devil's.
 you know what
i really love about vince?
 what?
he's a force of nature.
 you're outta control.
 no, i am not.
that poetry he pretends to write,
they're old song lyrics.
i know. geez,
you think i don't know that!
 i don't think you know that.
 well, i do.
it's this style thing.
that's how he expresses himself.
and he means it, even if
he doesn't know he means it.
 vince has a truly romantic soul.
 i can't hear this anymore.
well, don't, 'cause if you
had a boyfriend like i have,
you'd make him a cake
and he'd love it...
and you'd get laid.
 ah!
 excuse me.
excuse me.
she's not bad.
i had no idea
that these magazines...
had things like
this inside, inside them.
you didn't? where've you been?
a deserted island?
i come from a tropical island
in the south pacific.
it is around 300 nautical miles,
south, southwest of fiji.
i just got here yesterday
and i already found my brother
your brother?
that's right.
my twin brother, vincent.
 twins?
 vince!
 linda.
 hi.
oh, you look gorgeous
in this light.
 you do.
 really?
hi. who's this guy?
this is vincent's brother
 i didn't know you had a brother
 me, either
you know each other?
allow me to introduce
these lovely ladies.
 this is linda.
 hi.
 hello.
 her charming sister, marnie.
sisters?
twins?
are you sure
this guy's all right?
he's okay.
he's helping me out.
he's from outta town,
kinda latched on to me.
okay, well, great seeing ya.
catch ya later
great seeing ya.
catch ya later
oops!
i have only been
driving an hour
 linda's your girlfriend, isn't she?
 yeah, kinda.
 is marnie your girlfriend, too?
 marnie?
marnie hates my guts.
she kinda likes you, though.
 me?
 yeah.
 she hardly knows me.
 that's the best way.
you see,
women love men...
who are mysterious
and devious.
keeps them on their toes.
it excites them. you know what i mean?
no.
 you do like women?
 very much so.
they're strange
and sensitive.
they have compassion.
i have the highest
respect for women.
you're a virgin!
that's private.
a 230 pound virgin.
it is all right.
it is something
it is just one
of those things.
oh, julius.
my little baby poodle.
such a baby cat.
look, did i neglect you?
not anymore. come on.
that's a good little pussy cat.
this is sweet julius.
okay, here you go.
you named
your cat julius?
the secret to takeout eggplant
parmesan is extra cheese.
 there we go.
 that much cheese?
oh, yeah.
the more cheese, the merrier
there you go.
i know you're probably used to
growing your own vegetables...
and spearing fish on the lagoon,
but here on the mainland,
we just nuke it.
that's it. here we go.
feast your eyes.
dinner is served.
 yummy.
 yeah.
 ahhh!
 ahhh!
through the lips, over the gums,
look out
look out stomach, here it comes.
tadum!
 julius!
 oh, i like nuked food.
 mmmmm!
 mmm!
now let me get
this straight.
one of our fathers was
a famous football player?
 yes!
 and another one was...
 a physicist at m.i.t.?
 yes, he won the nobel prize.
naturally! all of our dads
were these big shots.
and mom...
was like... superwoman.
but she didn't survive
the delivery.
and i was sent
to an orphanage,
while you were raised
on a tropical paradise...
by a scientist who
you do research for,
but who doesn't pay you,
because you don't need money.
did i leave anything out?
i think it's important we try
to find our fathers.
oh, you mean the geniuses
who contributed...
to the sperm milk shake.
why are you being so immature
about all this?
do you know how many times
i have heard stories like this?
it is every
orphan's fantasy.
my real mom and dad
were rich...
and beautiful.
but there was a mixup
in the hospital...
and i got switched
with another baby.
but one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door..
and there they'll be...
with open arms,
crying, my darling.
my treasure.
we didn't know.
how can we make
it up to you?
let me tell you something
for your own good, julius.
it is all a crock.
i liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.
here it is.
read it and weep.
dear sister anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...
 for vincent benedict has been denied.
 denied, yeah.
according to our files,
his mother did not die...
 during birth.
 she's not dead.
we have a current
address for her at...
172 canyon glen drive,
los angeles.
vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment,
and as such,
he's ineligible for aid.
that's right, julius.
she abandoned me.
this letter was written
we were five years old.
our mother didn't die
when we were born!
you knew all this time
where she was...
and you never
contacted her?
i don't know about your mother,
miss perfect, 1952,
but my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive,
i hope she's
in a lot of pain.
she dumped me once.
there is no way i'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.
if they have lied to us about mama
for all these years,
maybe they lied to her, too.
we got to find her
 we have to check this address.
 you do what you want.
i got a cash-flow problem.
 hello.
 hey, vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.
you better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.
or else what, you blimp?
oh, we're rollin'.
tests on the new low temperature
gaskets look great.
 mr garfield, there's a man
 not now.
 who are you?
 i'm webster
 it is okay!
 christ! you were never
supposed to come here.
we were never
supposed to meet.
 you're supposed to be
 driving that car down to texas.
i got my driving gloves.
i got my driving glasses.
i got my driving hat.
but i got no car
the car was there.
the merchandise was in the trunk.
your instructions
were on the cassette.
he wants more money.
that's what this is about.
 he wants more money.
 whoa, whoa. let me explain.
sit down.
i got a reputation
to uphold.
people put their trust in me.
they know i always
deliver the goods...
and i always come
back with the money.
this is making me look
very bad professionally.
 this is bullshit. the car was there.
 that's right.
the parking attendant
thought we were going to hawaii.
 the parking attendant?
 he liked the car
we put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.
you know,
i just realized that...
in over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...
has ever seen my face.
i don't think that's
a problem. hey!
no, please, please!
 hi.
 hi.
 oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here?
 grandpa,
this man wants
to talk to you.
thank you.
hello?
yes, can l help you?
i am terribly sorry
to disturb your party.
i know this may
sound strange,
but i'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.
mary ann benedict.
she was my mother
you're mary ann's son?
that looks just
like you, grandpa.
honey, why don't
you go inside...
and help grandma
with lunch, okay?
dad?
uh... no!
 but maybe technically speaking.
 dad!
dad!
 wait a minute!
 dad! it is you!
this is a big surprise.
dad, this is incredible.
i don't know what to
we could use a drink.
where'd you come from?
one of my fathers! you don't know
what this means to me.
uh, mr webster, i hope you are
happy with the vehicle...
we chose for
your little journey.
when you get near houston,
phone 7135550342...
and ask for uh, uh,
beetroot mckinley.
he will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.
thank you.
mary ann benedict.
i haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.
your mother was...
an amazing woman.
oh, the times i have wondered what would
have happened if i would have married her
why didn't you?
oh, i asked her to.
she turned me down.
she said she was afraid...
to have any more children.
see, they told her
you had died at birth.
who told her we died?
mitchell traven,
the guy with the clipboard.
he supervised the experiment
for the government.
he still runs a genetics lab
at los alamos, new mexico.
i'll have to pay
him a visit.
watch out for him.
he's kind of a dickhead,
if you know what i mean.
dickhead?
no, i don't.
but... i am learning.
i am concerned about the time frame.
that's my private line, honey.
i'll take care of that.
you boys, excuse me.
beetroot mckinley talkin'.
who is this?
uh, webster
i'm callin' from california.
i happen to have something
some merchandise
that you might want.
well, bring it to me, son.
let me enrich you.
well, uh, mr beetroot,
it's the amount
of enrichment...
that i wanted
to talk about.
don't try and renegotiate
with old beetroot, son.
now look, beetroot,
if we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.
look, there's no way,
mr beetroot,
that i'm going to deliver
any damn cadillac...
unless i know for sure
that i have...
twenty for my cut.
twenty! you little
shit for brains peckerwood!
you're out of your
goddamn, greedy mind!
 i guess that seems
a little high for you.
 yeah!
i am a reasonable man.
how about fifteen?
 the deal is five!
 five?
i could do better
than five here.
if you can do better
than five million dollars,
well, then, son,
you take it.
beetroot,
i'll see you in houston.
after all, fair is fair
i'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer
well, good.
five million!
five million dollars!
five milllion dollars!
five million dollars!
five, five million dollars!
five million dollars!
five mmillion!
cash, lots of cash.
whoa!
listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, vincent.
 you scared the living shit outta me.
 i met one of our fathers.
he told me about
a man in new mexico...
 who probably knows where mom is.
 oh, great! yes!
 listen, she didn't abandon you.
 no?
you know what i mean?
she didn't abandon you.
 she didn't even know you were born.
 oh!
 they told her that i died.
 no kidding?
look, julius,
i'm in a hurry.
 you know sammy, who gave me this car?
 yeah.
you remember sammy? he wants me
to take this car to houston.
 so i'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
 houston?
 oh no!
 you know something?
new mexico's on
the way to houston.
a lot of places are
on the way to houston.
use the house,
make some phone calls.
throw wild parties.
take advantage of your brother
we have to see this man, traven,
in new mexico.
 no, we don't have to see
this man in new mexico.
 yes, we do!
and i'm coming with you.
we'll go see the man.
 i take a shower i get my bags.
 get your bags.
be right out. oh, boy!
i'll be here, bro.
okay.
this place is a zoo!
wait, wait.
 happy birthday, vince.
 oh.
 happy birthday, vince.
 god.
 it is not my birthday.
better late than never
 oh.
look what marnie
made for julius.
 you baked?
 yeah. is julius around?
 he's taking a shower
 i'll go give these to him.
sooo!
 where'd you get this car?
 sammy. you know sammy.
 where you going?
 inside. have some coffee?
you're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say goodbye.
take out your papers and your trash
or you don't get
no spending cash
if you don't scrub
the kitchen floor
you ain't gonna
rock and roll no more
yaketyyak yaketyyak
don't talk back
marnie!
excuse me, but i was
just taking a shower.
good singing.
i baked you some cookies.
 cookies?
 i guess it was a dumb idea.
no, not at all. i'm really
looking forward to tossing them.
 i should put on some clothes.
 i am sorry, i'll turn around.
linda and i just came by
'cause she baked him a cake...
 for his birthday.
 i had birthday, too.
oh, that's right.
you're twins.
huh?
whoa.
what is it?
i don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.
 a fortune? that's great!
 yeah!
excuse me!
excuse me.
never sleep with that man,
never loan him money,
never believe a word he
tells you. that's free advice.
 good morning, agnes.
 vince?
i cleaned her pipes once.
let's go have a cup of coffee.
vincent,
i'm comin' with you.
linda, no,
you're not coming with me.
 yes, i am.
 no, you're not coming.
you could get killed and die and
i wouldn't know what happened.
 no!
 you say no one more time,
i am gonna tell everybody that there's
shut up! shut up!
all right. oh, god.
all right, you're coming.
but you do not tell julius
what's in that trunk.
he thinks we're going
to look up our ancestors...
like in roots or something.
all right?
 does this one look okay?
 it looks fine.
it is good you didn't have
to borrow his pants.
 marnie, guess what?
 linda, what?
vince just asked us to go to new mexico
and texas with him.
this is a great idea.
 vincent, is this true?
we all go together?
 yeah.
i thought it was a great idea
if we all hopped in the car..
and spent a few days
on the road together
nice shirt.
 feels great. it is all cotton.
 well, it breathes.
it is okay. come out.
all right. here, linda.
oh, can i ride
in front with vincent?
 sure.
 thanks.
now, let me see.
i'm supposed to be
giving you one of these.
sorry, it's my first day
on the job.
have a nice day.
now, where do i find
this very special person,
mr vince benedict?
well, what have we here?
what a cute little kitty.
where's daddy?
well, well, well.
thank you very much.
open up, vince.
we know you're in there.
come on, we just
wanna talk to you.
howdy!
who are you?
it is not really
important, is it?
i was just feeding the cat,
then i was gonna leave.
i asked you a question.
 well, who are you?
 we're the klane brothers.
that's burt, this is
morris, and i'm bob.
 interesting gene pool.
 don't cast dispersions.
i beg your pardon. but you're
looking for vince benedict.
 right.
 am i vince benedict?
so what difference
does it make who i am?
 hit him, bobby.
 yeah.
hey! all right.
your brothers seem to have
a problem with their feet.
 could be contagious. bye, bye.
 ow! ow!
ow! ow! ow! ow!
 you want a doctor?
 ow!
i'll call a doctor
sorry i tore your shirt.
i don't know what happened.
it is all right.
 julius!
 what?
 are you allergic to something?
 no.
then why are these bumps
all over your body?
you're all swelled up.
you look like you're ready to explode.
put this shirt on. there are
women and children present.
and your back,
it is worse than the front.
 it is like north dakota.
 you're so funny, vincent.
this is for the tshirt
and the sandwiches.
 born to be bad.
 yes, we are.
ooh, you're so scary.
linda.
linda!
well, what do you think?
 let's rock and roll.
 it is his first tshirt.
 honey, honey.
 yeah?
see if you can get us
a room with a kingsize bed?
 right.
 we'll get us settled.
we'll meet you here.
 okay.
 goodbye.
i don't need a kingsize bed.
i always sleep on the floor
uh, i don't know, jules.
i hope this is a good idea.
come on.
now, look,
promise me something.
if this professor traven
has never heard of,
you know,
mom or us twins...
or all our dads
or the experiment,
you won't be upset.
all i want him to do
is tell us the truth.
i don't know who you are
and what you're talking about.
get the hell out of here
before i call security.
well, that's that.
on to houston.
 he's lying!
 take it easy. he said
he was gonna call security.
for the first time in my life,
i am pissed off!
julius, don't do this to me.
i got a car to deliver
the last thing i need is
a detour in the slammer
 i am gonna make him tell us the truth.
 no!
that's our mother
those are our six fathers.
that's werner
and that is you.
 so start talking.
 everything okay, dr traven?
um, yes. everything is okay.
i will take care of it.
well, vincent,
you turned out just like
i thought you would.
what did you do,
escape from prison?
how'd you know my name?
i named you.
we sealed this door
the day after you were born.
well, come on in.
this is what you wanted to see.
you came out first,
of course.
we weren't expecting...
him.
this, uh...
must be where you
made the milk shake.
we weren't
making milk shakes.
we were making the most fully developed
human the world has ever seen.
but instead of just
one perfect kid,
mom had the two of us. way to go, mom!
wrong!
the embryo did split
in two, but...
it didn't split equally.
all the purity and
strength went into julius.
all the crap
that was left over..
went into what you see
in the mirror every morning.
whoa. you telling me
i am the shit?
 this is not true.
 wait, julius.
you're telling me that i'm
the leftover crap? that i'm no good?
 he's wrong.
 look at him.
are you saying that
i'm a side effect?
you haven't got the brain power
to understand this...
and i haven't got the time.
show's over
hey, dickhead.
tell us where
our mother is.
um... whispering pines.
it is an artists' colony
if you're lying to me,
i'll be back.
come on.
my life just got
flushed down the toilet.
no, vincent. your life
is just about to begin.
i'm genetic garbage.
we're twins.
we're basically the same.
julius, i know this is
a touchy subject for you,
but we don't look the same,
we don't act the same,
 we don't talk the same,
we don't dress the same.
 i know.
so if we're so much the same,
how come we're so different?
we had six fathers.
we're different parts of
a lot of different people.
yeah?
don't forget. i was taken
to a beautiful island.
i was loved. i was
protected, educated.
you had nobody, vincent.
nobody to love you,
to trust you, to encourage you.
all life taught you was
that the only person you...
could count on was yourself.
you see, vincent,
you're the missing part
of my life.
and i'm the missing part
of your life.
when we find mama,
we can fill the
missing part of hers.
we won't be alone anymore.
we can be a family.
a family?
yes.
you mean, like,
with a christmas tree,
and thanksgiving dinner?
and a real home,
where you'll
always be welcome.
always?
even when you've been bad.
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
yeah, yeah, ooh.
yes, ummm. oh, look.
 is this really necessary?
 yes, of course it's necessary.
i am not going to introduce
you to my mother looking
like a goat herder from albania.
you need clothes.
 but i feel fine the way i am.
 but you look like a
 hello, can i help you?
 do i look like i need help?
here's the problem.
we gotta do a whole ensemble.
do i look okay?
you look better let's put it that way.
you know what
we have to do, jules?
we gotta work on the way
you're walking.
you look a little stiff.
you ever see frankenstein?
 i read the book.
 that's not gonna help.
when you walk, you gotta walk
like you're moving to music,
and i don't mean
a military march.
like, you know, aretha franklin
and otis redding...
and wilson pickett,
a couple of white people.
 like this?
 yeah. bop! that's it.
 yeah, loose!
 oh, i like that.
i got something for you.
try these on.
 sunglasses?
 yeah, here you go.
now, that's it.
there. yeah!
that's it. yeah!
 whoops!
 whoa!

 mr ice.
yeah, just breeze
on through. yeah!

you're making me nervous!
 well, you're nervous.
 you've got to help me.
 what?
 i have never been out on a date before.
 that's okay.
 i don't know what to do.
well, you talk to her
you buy her a couple of drinks.
you dance with her, bro
you gonna dance with her.
you dance?
 oh, you probably never
did that before, either
 no.
oh, well, look.
all right.
the first thing is,
jules,
forget about disco.
 right? no disco.
 no disco.
when i really wanna
romance a girl...
i waltz with her
rahtahtah
rahtahtah
 you mean, like strauss?
 yeah.
it turns 'em into
putty in your hands.
rumpbumpbum
diddillyumpbump
rumpbumpbum, rumpbumpbum
rumpbumpbum
come on, let's assume
the dance position.
i'll give you
a couple of pointers.
 i really appreciate that.
 come on. let's go.
i hope nobody's
looking in the window.
come on, like this.
here you go.
put your feet by my feet.
come on. let's go.
by my feet...
not on my feet.
thanks very much.
 sorry, vincent.
 minor oversight.
grab my hand.
come on.
yeow! ah! ease up!
 tiny bit. let the blood
flow through the fingers.
 oh, like loose?

one, two, three.
see what you're doing with your teeth?
you're grinding them.
don't grind your teeth.
don't grind your teeth.
relax your jaws, yeah.
now try to count without
moving your lips, all right?
 one, two, three.
 one, two, three.
see? that's it.
you're not wrestling a boar..
southwest of fiji.
way to go, jules!
ahhh!
did you know they had beer
in ancient egypt?
 oh, yeah?
 no.
it was actually the assyrians
that developed the beer
the egyptians were the first
to perfect the malt process.
 you know a lot about beer
 he knows about everything.
it is all from books.
until tonight, i have never had a beer
all theory, no practice.
the story of my life.
 awww!
 we're gonna change all that.
aren't we, marnie?
 marnie.
 what?
am i shitfaced yet?
excuse me, but...
my back teeth are floating.
excuse me, i have to check if
my back teeth are floating.
good shot.
woohoo! ooo!
oh, god. we both flushed at
the same time before we did it.
yeah, right. woohoo!
hey, jules. marnie's
got the hots for you, babe.
tonight is your lucky night.
i know it.
 i don't think marnie likes me.
 you kidding? piece of cake.
this woman is ripe.
you're nervous...
because it's your first time.
perfectly natural.
really.
were you nervous
the first time?
i was 12 years old and she was
a nun. talk about pressure.
whoa!
come on, hit 'em.
 what?
 hit 'em, hit 'em.
oh, hit 'em,
hit 'em.
julius...
you know...
julius, i have
to admit this.
since you and i
first met, uh,
my life has been just
getting better and better
mine, too.
i am so happy, vincent.
i feel like
sometimes, like...
 picking you up and hug you...
 whoa!
and hug you,
hug you, hug you.
hey, he's my brother
oh, lay off
the beer, julius.
did you tell anyone
we were coming to santa fe?
i called work and told them
we wouldn't be in for a few days.
oh, i forgot to tell you
we were fired.
 oh, no.
 you hated that job.
 nice of your boss to tell us
where we could find you.
 oh, no.
hi, girls, you don't mind if
we join you and listen to some music.
the klane boys.
what an unpleasant surprise.
vince, this has
gone way beyond...
 a case of simple loan delinquency.
 we don't like being shot.
shot? who shot you?
 what do you want?
 we want to take vince...
 out to the parking lot and kill him.
 ohhh, owww!
don't you think
that's a little drastic?
let's go.
don't touch him.
ohhh!
hey, big fella.
you wouldn't want me to hurt
the lovely lady, would you?
you moved too soon.
 what?
 the second rule in a crisis:
uhoh. he's startin'
that funny talk, again.
lf you choose to bluff,
you must be prepared
to have your bluff called.
this is no bluff.
these are my cousins,
sam and dave.
get these jerks
outta here.
i'm so proud of you.
i love it when you hit people.
you got a lot
of rules, jules.
what a day.
first we visited
our birthplace,
then we bought
new clothes.
i got a bucket of ice and
a very good bottle of wine.
 then we danced the waltz.
 yes, we did.
 it is too bright.
 then we got into a fight.
 we have this beautiful room.
 perfect. yes, it is beautiful.
life just doesn't
get better than this.
 oh, yes, it does. good night.
 where are you going?
i'm gonna go tuck linda in
and maybe read her a bedtime story.
don't wait up for me.
tonight is your night, bro
it is your night, bro
oh, vincent, you locked
yourself out.
 marnie.
 hi.
 hi.
 vince and linda wanna be alone,
so i'm afraid i'm gonna
have to stay here tonight.
 you mean you're gonna
sleep here tonight?
 uhhuh.
which bed should i take?
either bed will be fine.
i always sleep
on the floo
 good night.
 good night.
julius.
 good night.
 good night.
 oh, no.
 what?
 what's the matter?
 this bed is lumpy.
you mind if i share
the floor with you?
you're teasing me,
aren't you?
a little.
what do i do now?
we'll figure it out.
 oh, vince.
 tonight is our night, bro
why are you
doing that now?
mom hasn't seen me
in all these years.
i wanna look my best.
 tonight
 your mom's gonna love you
whatever you look like.
and you look
really good.
i know, i know,
i know, i know.
so like this.
one, two, three.
are you a little nervous?
 just a little.
 nine, ten.
 linda.
 what?
like, what if she's
disappointed in me?
if she's disappointed,
then she's a fake.
i don't know what else
a mom could want in a son.
 huh?
 you're right.
you're right, you're right.
why am i worried?
 what am l worried about?
 i don't know.
you got it all.
 i couldn't do this without you, linda.
 yeah.
you know,
i have been thinking...
 that when we get back...
 yeah?
i think we should
move in together
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
 oh, no, no.
 it is not oh, no.
 it is not no, no, no, no, no.
 no, no, no, no, no, no.
i don't want to get married
and it's not that i wanna...
keep track of you,
because i don't need to.
i just wanna
live with you.
it would be fun.
linda, look at me.
do i look like somebody
who could play house?
i'm cranky in the morning,
i'm grouchy in the afternoon,
i'm moody at night,
i'm like miserable.
i know what
you're like.
let's sleep on it, okay?
sleep on it.
 okay, one night.
 this is going to be great.
tomorrow i'm taking my best girl
to meet my mom. i'm so excited.

 yeah, you, you.
 linda, there's no other girls.

 'cause i only have eyes for you
 that sounds familiar
 it is a good song.
you like that song, huh?
and i only have eyes
for you
shebop shebop
shebop shebop
shebop shebop
i only have eyes for you
shebop shebop
shebop shebop
shebop shebop
just for you
shebop shebop
oh, it's huge.
oh, it's beautiful.
not to mention valuable.
real estate like this
is worth a fortune.
you mustn't always
think about money.
you got me all wrong,
julius.
i'm just saying
it's nice mom's loaded.
that's a worry she won't
have to have in her old age.
hello,
can i help you?
 yes, yes, yes.
 oh, um, excuse me.
we are looking for
mary ann benedict, please.
i'm sorry, but
that's not possible.
look, we've
come a long way.
and believe me, she's gonna
be very happy to see us.
you're gonna have to
write to the benedict foundation
stating your business.
i am sorry. good day.
 foundation?
 millions, julius.
mama's rich.
we gotta go see her
buckaroos.
 let's get in there.
we gotta talk to her
 we sneak in.
 how is it?
 yeah, it's clear throw me over
okay.
vince?
vince, are you okay?
yeah, shut up.
come on, come on.
what a lovely day.
hey, vincent, don't you
think this is mama?
it could be. yeah.
don't just stand there.
go introduce yourselves.
hey!
 should you people be here?
 uhoh.
that depends on how you feel
personally about trespassing.
does he always try
to be funny like that?
 we're looking for
miss mary ann benedict.
 yeah.
 is she here?
 yeah, she's here.
she's here!
sneaking in like that,
i should call the police.
no, no, no. you don't want
to do anything like that.
this is not your everyday,
average situation.
she's our mother,
is the thing.
 we're her sons.
 twin sons.
you're comedians.
 no.
 no. we
we're kind of a surprise.
i'll bet you are.
follow me.
 we were right.
 it is her
excuse me.
 we thought that this is
 mary ann benedict?
this is an artists' colony.
there are a lot of painters.
come on.
i can't wait to meet her
 yeah.
 it has gotta be amazing.
look. mary ann benedict
never understood...
why people wanted
to buy her paintings.
but for a brief period,
they were considered valuable.
she used the money
to buy whispering pines.
may i ask you a question?
why do you keep referring
to her in the past tense?
because...
she passed away
some time ago.
she passed
you just you just said
she was here.
i meant, her spirit.
her spirit is always here.
come on.
can we get the hell
out of here, please?
those damn real estate developers!
they won't be happy until
they turn this into a golf course.
oh, is that
who they were?
they're shameless.
they'll try anything.
do you know those men claim
to be my twin sons?
 if you can believe that!
 what?
it was really
quite upsetting.
mary ann, i am sorry.
it is all right.
it doesn't matter
you get over things.
i did have a child once.
but he died at birth.
you should be proud of her
she donates her house, land,
and all her paintings
to young artists.
linda, do l look like
a young artist?
 all she meant
 i know what she meant,
and why she's here.
it has got nothing to do
with finding my mother,
and everything
to do with money.
 that's not true and you know it.
 bullshit!
take it easy, vincent.
this is not her fault.
take it easy, vincent.
this is not her fault.
look who decided
to chime in!
the creature from
the black lagoon.
i should've had my head
examined listening to you.
a deal of a lifetime
opportunity,
and i'm out looking
for a dead mother
 all i wanted was to
make us into a family.
 family, my butt!
there's no family here.
there's nothin' here
except me and three losers.
i don't know
why i listen to people.
 i don't know why i do it.
 cut it out.
vince!
 i'm leaving.
 no, stop!
stop! what are you doing?
you're acting
like a fourth grader
where do you think
you're going?
he dumped us in
the middle of new mexico.
i can't
julius!
you don't know this,
and i promised vince
that i wouldn't tell you,
but he's got something in
the trunk that's worth millions.
i'm worried he's gonna get
himself killed delivering it.
okay, yeah. yes, mr beetroot.
yeah, i'll find it. yeah.
yes, i have a map.
all right.
i'll see you there.
see you in houston
in the morning.
i'll be looking
forward to it.
what a coincidence.
that was our friend.
looks like i'm gonna be
doing business with... him.
sorry.
i would have done
the same thing.
you want the merchandise.
it is not your problem who delivers.
precisely.
but how will
you find him?
i have him in my head.
i found him once,
i'll find him again.
i hope so. bye.
be careful.
sorry i'm late.
 the directions you gave me weren't
 step back.
get over here.
i'm unarmed.
he's clean.
oh, oh.
isn't that pretty!
yeah, it is.
 did you come here alone, unarmed?
 yeah.
you're just some fool
who stole a car?
yeah, i guess i am.
you don't know what
the hell this is, do you?
no.
revolutionary fuel injection
system for jets.
worth a fortune to the company that
brings it to the market first.
somebody else developed it,
but i just had to have it.
crafty devil, huh?
what are you waiting for?
wait a minute, beetroot!
 i thought we had a deal.
 we do.
five million bucks!
 you wanna count it?
 no, no.
 but i could use a lift to town.
 don't press your luck.
okay. that's all right.
i gassed it up for you,
beetroot. thank you!
five million dollars!
five million bucks!
hahaha!
five million bucks!
i have gotta look at it!
uhoh.
hey, benedict!
all i want is the money.
just give me what's mine
and i'll leave you alone.
steps! steps!
leave my brother alone.
no.
you.
no, no, no.
no, no.
julius, you're
you're here?
no. no, you idiot.
don't be nervous.
i hate violence.
plus i never carry a gun.
who are you?
whoa, whoa, whoa!
put the gun down.
i got the money.
here's your money.
here's your money.
here's the money.
you're a goddamned millionaire.
you, i am never
gonna forgive... never
 open it.
 open it?
you were going
to get killed.
 i was trying to distract him
so you could escape.
 i already had escaped!
i was halfway to brazil
when l felt you!
 close it.
 close it?
open it, close it.
open it, close it.
 why didn't you go?
 why didn't l go?
because thanks to you,
i'm not only a goddamned psychic
benedict!
 i think the case belongs to me.
 oh, sorry.
i got this disease
called a conscience.
 no one ever said being good was easy.
 no one ever said
will you two shut up!
butt out, pal!
you got your money.
now take it and go live in
the lap of luxury somewhere.
try brazil.
it doesn't work that way.
you've seen my face.
which one's first?
you gonna kill us, even though
we gave you the money?
you got it.
wait, you forgot the third rule
in a crisis situation.
 the third rule?
 third rule?
yeah, third rule.
oooh!
 the third rule.
 what's the third rule?
duck!
yo!
holyshmoly!
now there's a man
with a lot on his mind.
thanks for coming back,
vincent.
we're brothers, right?
 we're family.
 that's right.
a rich family.
 a good family.
 what? what?
 we're gonna return this money.
 no.
 we don't have to give it back.
 yes, we do.
 why? why?
 we have to, believe me.
 mary ann?
 hmm?
i think you'd better come
take a look at this.
what is it?
mary ann?
what a pleasant surprise.
you stole my family.
you lying son of a bitch.
linda, i am sorry.
i made a terrible mistake
and i apologize.
all i'm asking for
is another chance.
i know i don't
deserve this
that's right,
you don't deserve it.
vince?
yes, this is the
benedict corporation.
we are a consulting firm...
a think tank.
something like
the rand corporation.
 only smarter
 only smarter
tomorrow at 3:00.
yes, i'll put you down.
good night, mr benedict.
 good night.
 good night.
that's it.
the last check is written.
what do we have left out of
the $50,000 reward?
after we've paid off
all our debts,
we have exactly $12,278.
 $12,278. that's terrible.
 what?
you're just upset because
i made you return that suitcase.
oh, the money.
you mean the
four million dollars.
four million dollars.
just say it.
say it...
four million dollars.
it is a lot of money,
jules.
vincent...
i am very proud of you.
well...
yeah, i am kinda
proud of myself.
isn't it great to be one of
the good guys for a change?
it feels great
to be a good guy!
you're a great guy, too.
you came back for me, huh?
 you did steal a car though.
 i borrowed one.
i brought it back the next day.
i explained it to the man.
he was a cowboy.
excuse me? i am
oh, my god. i don't even know
which one is which.
i am sorry.
i didn't know.
you see, i didn't
believe your story.
who would believe
a crazy story like that?
they lied to me
all these years.
they lied to you, too.
you found each other
now you found me.
mama?
mama!
mama!
oh, mama!

the girl wouldn't stop talking.
my virtual girlfriend,
she talks, but at least
i can turn her off.
you and your virtual girls.
here you are, a grown man,
and your primary relationship
is with a piece of software.
if your senses tell you you have
a hot chick on your lap, you
have a hot chick on your lap.
i don't have to look
any further, okay?
they invented the laser razor
no nicks, cuts or scratches.
you should think about using it.
i like the old-fashioned
kind. they remind me
i'm still alive.
you want to hang out
at kelly's after work?
i know that natalie
is throwing me
a surprise party.
why do you say that?
because i told her
you told me.

you already told me that.
that too. but what i was going
to say was around 11:00, 11:30,
i want you to start singing
really loud, happy birthday.
for what?
and the way you sing,
it's gonna clear out the place
like a bomb scare.
i get it.
you and natalie have a little
private party planned.
good morning, rosie.
good morning, everybody.
hello, adam. hi, hank.
henry checked out
the upgrade on the remote.
he says you'll love it.
oh, they came in!
this is great.

oh, and drucker's office
just called. guess what?
they cancelled.
no. we're all gonna be tested
for drugs and alcohol.

how ya doing?
adam,
natalie's on line one.
what's up, honey?
you look upset.
oh, adam!
i just talked to the vet,
and they had...
they had to put oliver to sleep.
what?
he wasn't that sick.
i know, but apparently
he had some kind of highly
infectious virus or something.
and they had to put him down.
it's the law.
 oliver was licking
clara's face this morning.
 don't worry. i asked.
and the virus is harmless
to humans, so she's fine.
this is going to break
her heart
and you know that.
no, it won't.
i want you to go down to repet
and get oliver replaced.
i'm not going to have some
freak of science sleeping
in my daughter's bed.
 no! oliver can live on
in our memories.
 it's not dangerous.
she's only eight.
she won't understand that,
honey.
look, it's the natural process
of life. you're born,
you live and you die.
she has to learn about it
someday.
 but she doesn't have to learn
about it on your birthday.
 i really appreciate that.
 will you do it?
 no.
 thank you.
clara thanks you too.
 no. i won't do it.
listen. natalie,
i just won't...

how many of you have repets?
yeah, i got a dog.
i got a snake.
 i got your point.
 dogs, snakes or at least

 i know somebody, yeah.
 [beeping]
[blades whirring]
 you scared the crap out of me.
proud of yourself?
 very.
see you guys.
i know you're old school,
but all the kids today,
they grew up with repets.
 these days
it's totally normal.
 not to me.
not to you. you want your kid
crying because her dog died?
don't do anything about it.
don't you think
it's even a little bit creepy?
no.
i don't.
let's test the remote.
see if you can keep up with me.
all righty, here we go.
these repets,
they come back to you,
you cannot tell the difference.
 trust me, i had it done.
 bullshit.
[hank]
i'm serious!
sadie, my cat.
 she's a repet.
 you had your cat cloned?
 yeah, she fell out
of my condo window.
 ouch.
shit!
whoo!
whoa!
you did well.
thank you.
how long are you supposed
to keep me at kellys?
till 7:00. why?
maybe we should
check out repet.
good morning.
you gentlemen the owners?
yep, that's us.
excellent.
larry stern.
i'm with mr drucker's
advance team.
i've got a contract here.
i think you'll find it
pretty standard except for..
who was flying that one?
me...
with the remote control.
 we can fly four of these
between the two of us now.
 amazing.
 here for the blood test?
 no. my technician
is set up in your office.
you said these forms
are standard except what?
it's our normal
charter contract.
it has a nondisclosure clause.
during the flight,
you may overhear
mr drucker's phone calls.
it could be anything
from big mergers to inside
information on his sports teams.
regardless, we have
a legal obligation
to protect that stuff.
what does this guy think?
he's the president?
no, he considers her
to be the world's second
most important person.
ooh, that's big stuff.
all for a day
of snowboarding?
the blood test was agony.
seriously, i was screaming.
she's just kidding.
don't worry about it.
it really doesn't hurt.
just press your thumb here.
 right here?
 yes, just like that.
 all done.
 didn't feel a thing.
need to check your vision.
place your chin here.
look straight ahead.
 right here?
 mmhmm.
do you blood test
all your pilots?
pilots, drivers, assistants.
anyone who comes in contact
with mr drucker
hmm.
 all right, i press here?
 yep.
and here.
perfect, both of you.
after this, i'm going to town
to test a chef and two waiters.
the pink copy
of the contract is yours.
i'll take the rest.
here we go.
have a nice flight,
gentlemen.
tata.
you know, i could
take care of drucker
that way, you could have
time to get oliver cloned.
i'm not getting the dog cloned.
i'm just gonna check it out.
i know, but once you see it,
you're gonna say yes.
i know deep down inside,
you're a softy.
um, they specifically
asked for adam by name.
i know what specifically means.
i also know that the bodyguards
can't tell the difference.
they never got our names.
oh!
that's true.
i know that
i screw around a lot.
but when it comes to flying,
you know i'm serious.
i could do it.
go enjoy your birthday.
if you want to be me,
try to act
a little bit more manly.
yeah.
chest.
okay? chest out.
stomach in.
there you are.
stomach. all right.
[drucker into mike]
get me the speaker of the house.
i want the speaker there.
no, you don't mention
my name at all. huh?
hang on a second, dave.
hi, i'm michael drucker
you must be adam gibson.
that's right.
adam's the name
and flying's the game.
pete hume speaks highly of you.
he says you know
the mountains like nobody else.
thank you. that's probably
true for everyone except
my partner, but thank you.
i'm looking forward to it.
so, we all set?
yes, sir
we've stationed our people
monitoring the rescue beacons...
don't need the details.
all right!
your favorite snowboard's
behind your seat, sir
dave, look, we gave a lot
of money to his campaign,
not to mention what
i pay your law firm,
so i'm counting on you.
are you gonna get me
the speaker? good.
so, sally, who's next?
okay, put him on.
you own the roadrunners,
right?
[gunshot]
hey, buddy, wake up.
wake up! we're here.
woodland mall.
oh.
i was asleep.
[female over p.a. system]
welcome to woodland mall.
over 1200 retail outlets
to serve you.
food court, ground level.
[man]
stop the cloning.
say no to repet.
stop the cloning.
say no to repet.
stop the cloning.
save your soul, man.
god doesn't want you
to go in there.
then god shouldn't have killed
my dog.
atheist.
stop the cloning.
say no to repet.
we can clone your
fourlegged loved one
in just a few short hours.
how can we do it?
it all begins with
the growing of blanks,
animal drones
stripped of all
characteristic d.n.a.,
in embryonic tanks
at the repet factory.
in stage two, your pet's d.n.a.
is extracted from a lock of fur
or drop of blood...
and then infused
on a cellular level
into the blank.
in the final stage,
using repet's patented
cerebral syncording process,
all of your pet's thoughts,
memories and instincts...
are painlessly transplanted
via the optic nerve.
still can't make up
your mind, huh?
you lost a dog, right?
yes. my daughter's.
oh, what a heartbreak.
what'd you say
his name was again?
oliver
well, olivers in luck.
we're having a special
this week, 20% off.
when did oliver die?
sometime this morning.
that's perfect.
we can still do
a postmortem syncording.
but you've got to act fast.
'cause there's only a 12hour
window on deceased brains.
i have a problem
with that whole idea.
i mean, suppose
that clones have no soul,
or they're dangerous.
clone pets are every bit
as safe as real pets.
plus... they're insured.
if it is so safe,
then why is it against the law
to clone human beings?
because the human brain
is much too complicated
to syncord.
now, you remember that
experiment they did, right?
yes.
that's why that didn't work.
now it's illegal to even try.
but with pets,
it's a totally proven
technology.
your repet, oliver, will be
exactly the same dog.
he'll know all the
same tricks you taught him,
where the bones are buried.
he won't even know he's a clone.
and, did i mention?
they're insured.
i don't care about
the insurance.
i care about if i can trust
my daughter with a large animal
with sharp teeth.
we can make him smaller
if you want, with softer teeth.
you can?
we can even color coordinate him
to match your decorating scheme.
 [p.a. system] simpal,
the best friend money can buy.
 let me think about that.
 treat your kids
to a simpal today.
 i might be back.
you'll be back.
your daughter will think
you're the best dad.
my kid sister has two of
these, and she loves them.
oh, good.
let's fix the collar
there you are.
it's amazing
how real this is.
i know.
my daughter will be so excited.
come, let's go home.
 [female phone operator]
you have called hank morgan.
 i'm not here. leave a message.
hank, it's me again.
what the hell happened
to you?
i waited at kellys
for over half an hour
it's now five past seven.
i'm simpal cindy.
what's your name?
look, i'm heading home.
if you get this message...
let's be friends.
what's your name?

with a bunch of flowers
and a good excuse.
otherwise natalie's
gonna kill you.
i can sing songs.
would you like to sing with me?
excuse me.
do you know how
to turn this thing off?
 i can play games.
 my niece has one.
say, go to sleep, cindy.
go to sleep, cindy.
i can sing songs.
would you like to sing with me?
go to sleep.
thank you.
thanks for the ride.
good night.
clara, sweetie, honey.
oliver was very sick,
and he had to be put down.
clara, sweetie, honey.
oliver had to go to heaven.
why, daddy?
you see, it's because...
it's because...
oh, shit, oliver!
why did you have to die?
[barking]
oliver?
[barking]
natalie.

in my house,
eating my birthday cake...

and it's not me!
we know.
there's been
a sixth day violation.
a human was cloned.
that human was you.
we can help you.
 then get him out of there!
 but you'll have to come
with us.
look, i don't know
who the hell you people are.

[brakes squeal]

about that damn doll!
i have a booboo.
[screaming]
this is crazy.
why does anyone want
to kill me?
he got home first.
you saw him. he didn't see you.
you're screwed.
he's gonna live out the rest
of your boring little life
and never be the wiser
your wife and kid see you
and him together,
they'll be killed.
[screams]
 whoa!
 [horn honking]
 oh, shit!
 [horn honking]
no!
[groans]
goddamn it, wiley!
son of a bitch!
stupid!
blow out his tires this time!
oh... shit!
yes!
[laughing]
[vincent]
that was spectacular
oh, son of a bitch.
hold my belt.
 okay.
 [grunting]
you got me?
yeah.
little more.
oh!
[chuckles]
let's get some people downriver
and look for this guy.
go pick up wiley
and talia's bodies,
get 'em back to the lab.
[protestors]
weir clinic, stay away!
hello, i'm dr griffin weir
welcome to the new home
of the weir organ
transplant facility...
thanks for visiting
replacement technologies.
we're in the business of life.
[female reporter]
dr weir, protestors claim
cloning human organs...
will inevitably lead
to cloning whole humans.
that's not only illegal,
but we're years away from
the technical ability to do it.
but a human was cloned
over ten years ago, doctor
and we all know the outcome
of that bizarre experiment.
if you recall, the supreme court
ordered that the clone
be destroyed, and i think...
that under the conditions,
it was the humane thing to do.
it led to the laws
against human cloning...
and set back the course
of legitimate research
by many years.
mr drucker? mr drucker?
you gave $100 million...
this is dr weir's night.
dr weir, is it true
that you're trying to get
the sixth day laws repealed?
dr weir is interested
in medicine, not politics.
mr drucker,
the protesters outside claim
that you run repet at a loss...
in order to soften people up
to the idea of human cloning.
you know, we shouldn't forget
that not so long ago...
there were literally
almost no more fish
left in the ocean.
and half the world's population
faced a very real threat
of hunger
our cloning technology
helped turn that around.
the extremists
don't like to admit...
that they'd rather
the world went hungry
than eat cloned fish.
so instead they keep yelling
about human cloning.
do you think
the human cloning laws
should be changed?
suppose a tenyearold boy lies
in a hospital bed
dying of liver cancer
thanks to dr weir's work,
we can save that boy.
now, in the next bed lies
another tenyearold boy...
whose parents
love him just as much.
only this child has
an inoperable brain tumor
now, you cannot clone
a brain.
the only way to save him
would be to clone
the whole person.
how do you tell
that boy's parents
that we can save the first boy,
but the research
that would have saved their son,
it wasn't done because of a law
that was passed by frightened
politicians a decade ago?
so what does that mean?
enjoy the party.
looked like you needed rescuing.
yes, michael, i did.
thank you.
[chanting]
weir clinic, stay away!
no research on d.n. a!
[chanting]
weir clinic, stay away!
no research on d.n. a!
 [johnny phoenix]
hey, boss!
 johnny!
how's my star quarterback?
i'd say i was feeling like
a million bucks, except
id hate to take a cut in pay.
don't remind me,
all right?
that was one nasty hit
you took last week.
be careful, son.
we don't want you
getting killed out there.
katherine?
you all right?
i'm just feeling...
like i don't quite belong.
no, no.
but i'm fine.
really i am.
no, you're not.
should i call dr stevens?
no, no, no. no, no.
i just overdid it, that's all.
i'll get a car
to take you home, okay?
thank you.
[drucker]
mr speaker, thank you so much
for coming. champagne?
that was quite a speech.
you heard that? i didn't mean
to get carried away.
your words meant
a great deal to me.
you see, as it happens,
i have a son with an
inoperable tumor of the brain.
oh, my god!
i'm so sorry, sir
must've been in my subconscious,
knowing you were here, but i
never meant for you to overhear
no, no,
it's quite all right.
gave me a lot
to think about.
in fact, it gave me
a different view
of the whole subject.
mr speaker, could i offer you
a glass of brandy
in my office upstairs?
i was 50
when billy was born.
didn't know if i wanted
another kid so late.
but now i love him
so damn much.
if there was something
that we could do for billy,
only it was highly illegal,
would you consider it?
of course i would.
that's the same kind
of hypothetical situation...
no, no,
don't answer so fast.
you'd be facing a mandatory
minimum sentence of 40 years
if it ever came out.
but would he be cured?
he'd be exactly the same
as he was before.
perfect health.
he'd never even have
to know what happened.
but if the secret ever did
come out with the law
the way it is now,
he'd be put to sleep
like a rabid dog.
he'd be destroyed
just like a racehorse
with a broken leg.
[the speaker]
and if it never came out?
or if the laws were changed
one day?
then billy wouldn't have
anything to worry about.
[siren wailing]
[wailing continues]
please, i beg you,
go to my house and pick up
my wife and daughter
because if i go back there,
they will kill them both.
 you made a completely different
police report an hour ago.
 no, i didn't.
according to this, you did.
and they checked
your thumbprint.
that must've been
the clone.
i know it sounds crazy.
i can hardly
believe it myself.
 was your car stolen or not?
 yes.
 so you did report it?
 no. it was me who took it.
you stole your own car?
hello. i'm your court-appointed
virtual attorney.
you don't have to answer
is my client being officially
charged with auto theft?
 i didn't steal it. it's mine.
 he claims the report
was filed by his clone.
i see. loading
the virtual psychiatrist.
oh, mr gibson.
what seems to be the trouble?
do you want me to go through
the whole thing now
with him?
you seem to be avoiding
talking about your parents.
imagine, two turtles
are walking through the desert...
oh, shut up!
 hmm.
 hmm what?
are you going
to help me?
of course.
[female cloning announcer]
medical alert transmitted.
awaiting data.
just wait in here.
i'll come get you
as soon as we have some news.
clones!
[webcaster over tv,
indistinct]
he had a good laugh
when he read that story.
you know, he saw himself
at his house tonight.
which was
our mistake, not his.
[pager beeping]
excuse me.
he's in precinct seven.
could you hurry talia
and wiley along, please?
i'll need them both.
goddamn it! son of a bitch!
piece of shit wiley.
i'm gonna kill him.
where is he?
he's still cooking.
son of a bitch.
i look like crap.
do you have any idea how much
my hair treatments cost?
how much
does gibson know?
he knows he's been cloned.
he knows we'll kill anyone
who sees them together
what's that? what?
does drucker know you're talking
about killing innocent people?
relax, it was just a threat.
of course we'd never
actually do it.
try to have a good night.
you do your hair
i'll take wiley and vincent.
i've gotta pierce
my damn ears again.
officials
blame the latest strike
by u.s. major league players...
now entering its fourth year..
on the lack of fan
identification with the two
teams playing in the series.
[continues, indistinct]
shit.
oh, no.
[gasps]
now what?
it feels tight
all across here where
the tires ran over me.
 you were run over by two cars
and your chest was crushed.
 exactly.
no wonder, right?
it's in your mind.
completely crushed,
as in dead...
as in you have
a totally new chest now.
then how come it's
hard to breathe?
tell you what. why don't
you just stay out here, relax?
fresh air will do you good.
government officials are openly
dismissive of the proposal.
[man on tv] this amounts
to an attempt by microsoft
to buy a state of the union.
[man continues, indistinct]
but if he goes off
his medication, paranoid
delusions come back.
...very sad,
because at other times
he seems almost rational.
[knocking on door]
[marshall]
gibson? gibson!
 you're dead.
 no, you're dead.
[cracking]
try to stay dead this time.
hank, it's me again.
what the hell happened to you?
i waited for over
a half an hour at kellys.
it's now five past seven.
i'm heading home, okay?
whoa, whoa. he's fine.
he's okay. he's our associate.
gibson must've knocked him out.
knocked him out?
he looks dead to me, doc.
no, his pulse is strong.
he'll be up and around
in no time.
we'll just get him
to the hospital.
easy, that's it.
whoa, whoa.
[cracking]
uh, let us know
if you find gibson.
honey, i'm home.
 darling, where are you?
 hi, sugar
 hello, my love.
 have you been working out?
 you look so good.
 thank you.
i recorded all your
sports programs for you.
 i thought maybe we could
watch them together
 i would like that.
or should i just take
this off right now?
no, no, no.
hold your horses.
oh, hank. i think it's so sexy
when you go right to the chair
i know you do.
[knocking on door]
oh, you're gonna have
to zip me up, sweetheart.
ah, ah, ah. careful
with the merchandise.
[moans]
hold on, please.
have they been here?
who?
hello, adam.
would you like a beer?
i'm sorry
i missed the party, but...
all of a sudden it's 11:00
and i wound up at kellys.
you missed my party?
yeah, but i didn't
do it on purpose.
it was sort of weird.
i really feel terrible about it.
i don't know what happened.
you feel terrible?
i lost my wife, my daughter,
my whole goddamn life tonight.
 i'm gonna do
my special dance.
 hank, listen.
i need your help.
hey, not now, cupcake, i can't...
what's going on?
i don't understand.
[clattering]
shh!
that's a real gun.
shh!
what's going...
shh!
[screeching]
jesus christ! what are you
gonna do, kill my cat?
what the hell is going on?
if you weren't at my party,
then you didn't see him.
who's him?
[hammering]
jesus h. christ, i said
get your dog cloned,
not yourself.
what are you gonna do?
i'm gonna take my life back.
what, you're
gonna kill him?
why not? he's not real.
plus, there's no law against it.
you're not serious.
i'm dead serious.
but look at him.
he looks just like you.
technically, this could be
committing suicide.
but he is not me.
he is not even human.
wait a sec.
how do i know he's not you
and you're not him?
i mean, look at him,
he's even a shitty carpenter
well, let me see your chin.
my chin?
yeah, you cut yourself
shaving, right?
all right, here.
okay, it's there.
you're you.
shh!
adam.
i couldn't do it.
 adam?
 over here.
i have a little
something for you.
is clara asleep?
oh, yes she is.
 he's grabbing her ass.
 oh, i like how
cigars make you feel.
ooh.

 i had a bad dream.
oh, ill take you back
to bed, okay? come on.
fireman.
fireman, right.
 wait here.
 okay.

i can't wait.
how do you like it?
mmm, this is so good.
you want to try some?
no. you know, smoking's
illegal and i'm a mother
sweetheart,
im so sorry about the repet.
it's all right.
it's okay.
dad, did oliver die?
is he a repet?
why do you say that?
you locked him outside.
i did? i'm so sorry, but
i haven't been myself lately.
[car approaching]
all right.
you go to sleep now, okay?
close your eyes.
when was the last time we did it
in the backseat of the car?
well, we should
smoke cigars more often.
mr gibson.
who are you?
millennium security.
sorry to bother you, but...
 got any i.d.?
 of course.
i'm sorry i was a little jumpy,
but we had a breakin tonight.
we know. we heard on the wire
your car was found in the river
i don't suppose they found
that bastard that stole it?
[twig snaps]
 hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
 relax. he's a friend of mine.
 [adam]
sorry about this.
 nice 'do.
he's just here to help me
fix the garage. oliver, heel!
now what?
go see.
sorry, but he's a repet.
he used to be a good watchdog.
now, he lets my car get stolen
and he barks at security guards.
i hate clones.
well, sir, we'll keep
an eye on your property.
 i'm gonna sleep much better
knowing you guys are around.
 you try to have a good night.
good night.
take it easy.
come on, let's hide.
stop it, oliver
stop it.
gee, you're glitchy
today. come on.
[door closes]
good oliver
that was a bad idea.
let's get out of here.
wait, we can't just leave them
here with that thing.
those were the guys
that were trying
to kill me.
it's dangerous
for natalie and clara
if i hang around here.
darling,
you're still awake?
i wanted to wait up for you.
thank you.
and i wanted to spend
some time with these flowers.
i see.
it took me 17 generations
to get this right.
well, if you told me
what you wanted...
oh, i know.
you could have engineered it
in half an hour
yes.
i'm not in that much
of a hurry, griffin.
want to get a cup of tea
and then go upstairs?
okay?
yeah. yeah, that's a good idea.
let's do that.
yeah. dear
okay. it's okay.
shh. just stay calm.
stay very, very calm.
what a night.
that was the longest
night in my life.
hello, adam.
i'm a oneman virtual girl.
but if you insert
the installation disk...
okay. nothing.
what the hell was that?
i felt fingers
going for my zipper
now, that's disgusting.
oh, that's disgusting?
i had to totally look away
when you and natalie...
the, uh...
you want a beer?
you saw the clone do something
with natalie while i took
clara into the house?
they did nothing.
come on. that's not
what i would have done.
well, what would you have done?
i would have...
 nothing.
 well that's what they did.
you know, nothing.
shit.
in the goddamn minivan.
in the minivan.
i mean, you know
what tobacco does to people.
 he smoked my stogie too?
 the bastard.
 oh, that son of a bitch.
 son of a bitch.
smoked your stogie.
and she couldn't
tell it wasn't me?
it didn't look like it.
she seemed, uh, happy.
oh, you have no idea
what it felt like
seeing her with him.
i should've killed that son of
a bitch when i had the chance.
it could have been worse.
it could have been someone else.
at least she's not cheating...
 hank!
 don't move!
 tripp.
 i'm not after you.
back away.
 back away!
 why did you do that?
don't do anything stupid now.
that's as far as you go.
is that you, hank?
[screams]
hank.
hey, adam. is hank sleeping
on the floor again?
that's so cute.
[tires screeching]
[gasping, mumbling]
on the six... on the sixth day,
god created man.
on the sixth day...
on the sixth day,
god created man. god created
man on the sixth day.
why the hell did you
kill my friend?
hank morgan was
an abomination to god.
he was a clone.
hank was no clone.
the real hank morgan
died this afternoon.
i know because i killed him...
so i could kill drucker
drucker's not dead.
it would be all over the news.
open your eyes.
drucker's a clone.
dr weir cloned drucker
dr weir cloned your friend.
dr weir cloned you.
[tires screeching]
they found us.
they found us.
 shoot me in the head.
 what the hell are you
talking about?
we have people at weir's lab.
i know who they are.
if they scan my brain,
they'll be killed.
shoot me!
god forgive me.
[screams]
doesn't anyone
stay dead anymore?
who are you people?
[electronic voice]
i.d. required.
please use biometric reader
to verify identification...
or the alarm will
sound in 10 seconds.
ten, nine, eight,
he shot my foot.
 seven, six, five,

four, three,
two, one, stand by.
come on.

shit!
you're gonna pay!
those were brand new boots!
 dad, you're coming
to my recital, right?
 i never miss your recitals.
i love you.
you're the greatest, dad.
unless her pseudomonas infection
clears up,i'm afraid
there's nothing we can do.
what about her d.n.a. scan?
it came up
with cystic fibrosis.
cystic fibrosis?
which is impossible
considering that
it's a childhood disease...
and she would have
been dead 30 years ago.
we're running
the scan again.
no, lll do it at the clinic.
if you could give us a moment,
please. thank you very much.
darling, sweetheart.
we're having you transferred
to my clinic, okay?
no. i'd like to stay here.
no. but i can help you
at the clinic.
if you stay here,
there's nothing i can do.
i know, dear
i'll die here.
yes.
katherine, please.
please listen to me.
no.
katherine died five years ago.
the feelings that i have
aren't mine, they're hers.
katherine, listen.
now don't do this.
i need you so much.
i need you.
i'm not afraid, griffin.
i want to die.
my time has already passed.
my love.
what am i to do
without you? what...
[chuckles]
you just water
my flowers, okay?
[protestors shouting]
thanks for visiting
replacement technologies.
we're in the business of life.
welcome to the new home of the
weir organ transplant facility
at replacement technologies.
excuse me, sir
i've gotta check that.
oh, sure.
help yourself.
 but you might want
to use these.
 why? what's in here?
lower intestines.
it's for dr weir, he's doing
a study on a flesheating virus.
that's okay, you can open it up.
just try not to breathe.
that's okay.
go ahead. you're cleared.
thanks.
[weir's voice]
what about her d.n.a. scan?
[woman]
it came up with cystic fibrosis.
which of course is impossible...
considering it's
a childhood disease.
she should have
been dead 30 years ago.
so we're running a new scan.
no, lll do it
at my clinic.
you've had five extra years
since you cloned me.
i treasure that.
katherine, please.
no,i'm not afraid.
i want to die.
my time has already passed.
can i help you?
uh, no, i just dropped my pen.
i'm all thumbs today.
thank you.
will you cut that out?
it's driving me crazy.
excuse me, but i nearly
had my head ripped off
and it hurts like hell.
it's only psychological.
your neck doesn't really hurt.
 oh, yeah? you'd know
better about that?
 yes he would, wiley.
it was your
old neck that got broken.
this is your new neck. get it?
 give me a break, i got
killed twice in two hours.
 we've all been killed before.
you know what bothers me?
i've never even seen
a white light.
never seen
any angels, nothing.
give me a break.
 ma'am, i already
have you logged in.
 what? when?
twenty minutes ago.
according to this, you just
entered a restricted area.
the son of a bitch
has got my thumb.
deactivate talia, put out
a security alert and seal off
drucker's office. let's go.
shit.
 can i help you?
 yeah.
you can stick
your thumb in there.
thank god.
what, more fundamentalists?
no, adam gibson. we think
he's in the building.
why wasn't he taken care of?
you've had all night.
there are four of you
and one of him.
well, two of him,
if you see what i mean.
he has a wife and kid, right?
yes, sir
 get them.
we may need the leverage.
 yes, sir
it costs me 1.2 million
each time i clone you people.
try to be worth the money.
they'll kill you
for seeing this.
they're doing
their best already.
where's dr weir?
his lab's over there.
dr weir
oh, i know about the intruder
the office called.
everything's under control.
it's not under control.
you had me cloned.
yes.
well, you cloned the wrong man.
how did you do it?
 you had to have my, uh...
what do you call it?
 your syncording. we had it.
give it to me.
i want my life back.
here, it's your syncording.
how did you get this?
i haven't been...
here.
the vision test.
only it didn't test your vision.
it took your syncording...
an exact picture of your mind.
and it took a sample
of your d.n.a.
with those two things,
we can clone a person
in two hours.
we had you on file so that
we could act quickly when
we were told you were killed.
told i was killed?
[electronic voice]
please don't drink and drive.
gibson family schedule...
clara's recital at school.
this is michael drucker's.
a syncording contains
everything in a person's memory,
and this is what drucker saw
and heard just before he died.
you don't become one
of the richest men in the world
without making enemies, so...
we back up
his mind religiously.
hey, you own
the roadrunners, right?
amongst other things. yeah.
you a fan?
no,i'm a big fan
of both those teams.
well, lll have
to get you some tickets.
you promise, right?
sure, lll do it right now.
sally, it's me. remind me
to get some roadrunner tickets
for adam gibson.
he's my pilot today. okay.
[tripp's voice]
on the sixth day,
god created man.
no,i'm about to get
on my snowboard.
 hey, he's got a gun!
 hey!
it's a fundamentalist.
he just shot them both.
you call marshall right now.
you hear me, sally? marshall?
no, you don't have to... sally!
[screaming]
an anticloning fundamentalist
killed everyone on board.
it should have been me.
well, we thought it was you.
drucker mentioned your name.
so we used your d.n.a. and
your syncording to clone you.
to resurrect drucker
we had to cover up the accident.
keep talking.
we cloned everyone. by the time
we figured out you switched
places, it was too late.
[electronic voice]
access denied.
they're trying to kill me.
because there are
two adam gibsons.
and that's proof that
humans are being cloned.
which makes you very
dangerous to michael drucker
tell me whyi'm a threat
to michael drucker
drucker was killed three
years ago. we cloned him then
and we cloned him yesterday.
 so?
 if that came out, drucker would
be destroyed in every way.
a clone has no rights.
a clone can't own anything.
drucker would lose all of this.
because drucker
would be legally dead.
 complete search from level
seven to level five.
 look at all the cameras.
you can't even find one guy?
 [man] there, there, there.
 i don't need to see
where he's been.
we need to find out
where he is now.
let's go. hit the alarm.
what's up?
what area is so sensitive
we don't allow cameras?
drucker will do anything
to destroy the evidence.
and you're the evidence.
this is evidence too.
[alarm blaring]
move, move!
clear the way!
let's go.
[chattering]
oh, no, no. she's been
rehearsing all week.
i have to go
to the bathroom.
okay, clara.
anyone else need
to go to the bathroom?
[sighs]
goddamn it!
[groaning]
why do you thinki'm telling you
this? i can do nothing to stop
what they're trying to do.
 there he is!
 zone six,
engineering corridor
move, move! clear the way!
and what they might be
trying to do to your family.
what about my family?
drucker has to kill one of you.
if he can't kill you,
he'll go for the other one.
and your family could
get killed in the process.
 get out!
 destination get out
not understood.
morgan randall
elementary school.
very sorry, sir
## [ballet on piano]
[growling]
daddy!
 she's supposed to be
up there now, right?
## [children singing]
this is the, uh...
that's odd.
i'm just gonna go
make sure everything's okay.
all right.
excuse me.
of course.
[dogs barking]
clara.
 oh, my god.
 mommy?
 mommy,i'm scared.
 i'm here. i've got you.
[beeps]
could you help us, please?
 what are you doing?
 see this?
it's the only thing keeping
the dogs from tearing her apart.
so be quiet and come with us.
# hide and seek
as long as they please #
# 'cause that's the way
the teddy bears have
their picnic ##
 [clara] no!
 [vincent] let's go!
 daddy!
 move it.
 adam!
[tires screeching]
natalie!
no.
you have reached
your call is important to us.
yeah, i know.
your yes or no answers
will help us in directing
police to assist you.
come on! yes.
are you reporting a felony?
thank you
for reporting a felony.
come on.
is the felony
in progress now?
yes.
thank you.
is there a current danger of
bodily harm to you or others?
yes!
[voice continues, indistinct]
forget about
talking to the police.
i tried that already.
[echoing]
who are you?
i know this sounds insane,
but i'm adam gibson.
what?
we don't have time for you
to be shocked right now because
they've got natalie and clara.
and i need your help
to get my family back.
they are my family.
that's for sleeping
with my wife in the damn minivan.
your report has been timed out
or canceled at your request.
it's him.
mr gibson, i believe
you have something of mine.
oh, no. i have
everything of yours.
i have the syncording that
proves you are a clone.
and i have everything
of yours... your family
in the palm of my hand.
 shall we trade?
 you read my mind.
just the highlights.
all right.
i'll bring the disk
to the double x charter
office at 10:00 tonight.
be there with my family.
did you have
to hit me that hard?
well, i had to stop you
from talking to the police.
yeah, that's a good one.
that should do it.
what are you doing?
testing it.
because i don't think you have
enough aluminum in there.
are you kidding me?
that's exactly the same amount
they used in the rainforest war
you shouldn't be talking.
the mess you left trying
to fix your garage.
you saw me working
on the garage?
saw you? i nearly shot you.
let's try it.
wow!
cool.
cool.
you'd better be miles away
when this thing goes off.
i'm more worried about
getting us into the building
to find natalie and clara.
i'll take my chances
getting out.
griffin.
here.
what are you doing?
yours, yours.
griffin, what's the matter?
my wife, katherine, is dead.
oh, jesus christ.
griffin, i don't know...
lm so sorry.
don't start with sorry.
don't start! don't start!
i am so sorry.
don't start with sorry!
i know about the congenital
defects you've been embedding
into the clone d.n.a.
there's my wife,
johnny phoenix and the others.
but, michael,
why my wife? why?
you're right, griffin.
it's a security protocol i
implemented. i didn't tell you
because you wouldn't understand.
what should i understand?
the only thing i understand
is that you gave my wife
cystic fibrosis.
griffin, calm down. someone
made a mistake. this was never
meant to hurt katherine.
oh, it didn't hurt her,
it just killed her
suppose we clone a senator
who's agreed to support us
but he goes back on his word.
what's the point?
or johnny phoenix
wants to double his salary.
by giving them shorter life
spans we guarantee our leverage.
what's the point?
the point is...
if they betray us, they're dead.
if they stay on the team,
we clone them again
and no harm done.
and that's exactly what
we're gonna do with katherine.
she's being cloned as we speak.
 no, she's not. no.
 no, she's...
griffin, it was a mistake.
if you're concerned about her
d.n.a., go through it yourself,
make sure it's clean.
and obviously, there won't be
any charge for the cloning.
oh, no charge.
thank you very much.
what you don't understand is
she does not want to be cloned.
so you do it anyway.
do it anyway?
i see.
let me explain
something to you.
it's very simple.
i loved my wife very much.
so much so that i promised
i would never bring her
back again, and i won't.
if i can't bring her back again,
lll never bring back
anyone ever again.
that's how much
i loved her
so it's over,
it's finished and i quit.
well, i can't let you quit.
yeah, well.
i've looked the other way
too often and lve justified
too much, so...
lm finished.
it's over
you know whati'm gonna do
for you, griffin?
what are you gonna do for me?
i'm gonna give you
the greatest gift that
you could possibly imagine.
a gift?
i'm gonna save your life.
i'm gonna save katherine.
i'm gonna save our friendship.
andi'm gonna save
your marriage.
michael, what are you
talking about?
i'm going to kill you now.
and theni'm going to clone you
using your latest syncording.
theni'm gonna clone katherine
using her last syncording.
you understand?
no.
do you see
whati'm doing for you?
you and katherine
will be back together..
and neither one of you
will remember that you ever
promised not to clone her
or that she even died.
and obviously, you won't
remember this conversation.
you're welcome.
[adam]
all right.
now show me my family.
bastards. i knew it.
your syncording isn't here
and neither is he. it was being
flown by remote or something.
both of you get back here now.
come on.
this is a private pad.
you can't land that here.
replacement technologies only.
i'm here to pick up
mr drucker
here.
 it's my charter contract.
 okay.
everything's normal,
mr drucker,
but we'll stay alert.
 what time are you
planning to take off?
 take off? no, i didn't...
your pilot's on his way
down to reception.
now you listen to me.
seal the building,
full security alert.
you find this pilot.
he is armed and very dangerous.
get wiley and some men
up to my office, now.
 freeze the elevators
and shut down parking garages.
 over there on monitor 12.
 zone six,
engineering corridor
 there, sector three.
he's headed right towards you.
turn around, turn around.
don't even try it.
get some people
up that west stairwell.
team three and four,
close up on him. let's go.
he must have shot a power box.
he's trashing the whole system.
we've got him trapped.
west stairwell,
between 13 and 14.
let's go!
[marshall]
cover the stairwell doors!
fire in front of him.
okay, you did pretty good.
you fooled us at the airport.
you managed to turn
this place into a shambles.
 want to make us come up there
and kill you? fine.
 you're the greatest, dad.
but mr drucker would like
to talk to you.
and of course
we do have your family.
all right.
go get him, go get him.
[door opens]
well, well.
 adam gibson.
 i wish i could say,
the one and only.
looks like we both
went back on our word,
didn't we?
 you might find we have more
in common than you thought.
 where's my family?
right to business.
an admirable trait.
there they are.
 all safe and sound.
 for the moment.
and your syncording,
it's not on him.
it's not in his whispercraft.
i knew you'd
doublecross me,
so i gave it to my clone.
if anything happens
to me or my family,
the next time
you'll see your syncording
will be at your murder trial.
 dr weir didn't
tell you, did he?
 tell me what?
adam, adam, adam.
he's not the clone.
you are.
i want you to ask
yourself something.
do you remember anything after
being scanned by my bodyguard?
[man #1]
i need to check your vision.
look straight ahead.
do you actually remember
changing places
with your friend?
[man #2]
hey, buddy, wake up.
we're here, woodland mall.
the salesman at the repet shop
thought it was odd
that you came in twice...
asked the same
questions twice.
still can't
make up your mind, huh?
you lost a dog, right?
[hank's voice]
let me see your chin.
you cut yourself shaving?
your shaving cut?
easily reproduced.
so was the scar
from your old war wound.
i know who i am.
i know you do.
talia, how many times
have you been cloned?
i've lost count.
there's one way to tell.
show him.
it's the only way
to keep track of what
generation a clone is.
see? four dots means
she's been cloned
four times.
come on. let's
take a look at yours.
come take a look in the mirror
let's find out if you are
who you think you are.
just under
your left eye.
kind of takes the fun
out of being alive,
doesn't it?
so you see, your family
is not really your family,
they're his.
and you, my friend,
are in exactly the same boat
as all of us.
if adam gibson gets that
syncording to the authorities,
we will all be destroyed.
if you really love
your wife and kid, you'll
tell me where adam gibson is.
we'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.
tell me where adam gibson is.
we'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.
we'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.
and they'll never have to know
that you're the clone.
it's that or lose them forever
you know, adam. i'm not making
this offer because i have to.
i can get everything i need
from your memories.
the fact is, i'd like you
to understand you'd also
be serving a higher purpose.
in two years, three tops,
i will control enough votes
to get the laws changed.
and then we won't have to lose
our best people. we won't
have to lose our mozarts.
we won't have to lose
our martin luther kings.
we'll be able to conquer death.
we will finally
be able to conquer death.
and who gets to decide
who lives and who dies, you?
you have a better idea?
yeah, what about god?
oh, you're one of those.
i suppose you think science
is inherently evil.
no, i don't think
science is inherently evil.
but i think you are.
if you believe that god
created man in his own image,
then you also believe
that god gave man the power
to understand evolution.
to exploit science,
to manipulate the genetic code,
to do exactly what i am doing.
i'm just taking over
where god left off.
if you really believe that,
then you should clone yourself
while you're still alive.
and why is that?
so i can understand
your unique perspective?
no. so you can
go fuck yourself.
now you're gonna
tell us where you put
mr drucker's syncording!
you won't find it in my head.
i told him to hide it so
i wouldn't know where it is.
we'll see about that,
won't we?
yeah, we will.
[grunting]
let's go. get in here.
come on! come on!
come on!
fine, have it your way.
# take a piece of me #
# a piece that you can't see #
# take a piece of me #
# the one that i won't give up #
# go easy on me ##
that didn't
hurt so bad, did it?
asshole.
let's go back a few minutes.
 [adam] here it is,
drucker's syncording.
 there's the other one.
keep this and wait here.
ifi'm not back in an hour,
you know what to do.
don't worry. anything
happens to you or my family,
lm gonna destroy
that son of a bitch.
you got the location?
the airport. i was just there.
he'll be dead in 20 minutes.
let's go.
betrayed by your own mind.
 wait, wait!
 what?
they staged that scene
for our benefit.
the other one
was sitting behind him
so we couldn't see him. look.
the bastard faked
his own syncording.
the other one was hiding
in the whispercraft...
and this one
avoided looking at him
so he wouldn't be in his memory.
 you mean the other one's
in this building too?
 yes, that's correct.
now, warn vincent.
put out another alert.
this one is the diversion.
he smashes all the cameras.
he gets himself captured.
meanwhile, the other one's
free to just stroll in here
and take his wife and kid.
idiot!
 oh.
 natalie! clara!
daddy!
oh, my god!
what's going on?
it's me.
daddy?
oh, god!
 don't worry, sir
get him up.
 oh, shit.
 everything's okay now.
 i'm scared, dad.
i'm scared.
this isn't because
of the cigar?
no, lll explain later
dad,i'm scared.
don't worry.
he's not going anywhere, sir
we'll get him. let's go.
wait! talia, you go.
you two stay here.
have 'em block
all the exits.
yeah, henderson, come in.
seal off the entire tank areas,
levels six and seven.
i'm trying, sir
give me a minute.
and get us some power
up here.
don't move!
my daughter is right inside
that door
now, i don't want
to expose her
to any graphic violence.
she already gets enough
of that from the media.
put your weapons down.
nice and easy.
good. now, when
you go inside, you say...
have a nice flight.
have a nice flight,
little girl.
friends of daddy's.
all right, let's go.
have a little midnight flight
with daddy and mommy.
there we are. all right?
sorry.
there you go, sir
wiley. go.
all right.
wiley, just wait one second.
 not again!
 [wiley screams]
and don't
bring him back.
stupid bastard blew a hole
through my stomach.
oh, god!
i'll be dead
in 20 minutes tops.
but what better place,
right?
henderson?
where's my power?
relays are coming
online now, sir
[henderson]
get all exits blocked.
all exits!
shit!
go start warming up
a blank.
i want a fresh syncording.
i want my mind
to be up to the minute.
okay, here it is.
this is a fresh one.
[marshall]
this will be
a complete syncording.
 [talia groaning]
 [drucker]
is that talia?
[talia]
shit!
go help her
we'll find him.
what have you got?
tanks three and four, nothing.
okay, go.
take the back walk.
 [yelling]
 [screaming]
 [gunshot]
no!
no.
[yells] oh, god!
[gasps]
[gasping]
oh, no.
 take her to your mother's.
stay there until i pick you up.
 i got her
come with us, daddy.
i have to help a friend, okay?
bye.
love you.
 [gasping]
 wiley, you shot me!
oh, right.
that was you.
i gotta get dressed.
[groans]
you're not even gonna wait
until... i die?
would you?
come on, get it off.
blood on the jacket.
jesus christ.
[gasps, mutters]
what?
[mumbles]
what?
 [gasps]
 what?
look. adam,
we can make a deal.
you have absolutely no reason
to kill me. i didn't do anything
to you. it was all him.
listen to me.
i can rebuild all of this
in a very short time.
i can still save you, adam.
save me?
we put congenital defects
into the clone d.n.a. to give
the clones short life spans.
you want to know what
you're gonna die of?
how long you've got to live?
we can go right upstairs,
right now,
and look it up.
we all have to die someday.
we don't have to die.
i'm offering you the chance
to live forever
never aging.
perfect in every way.
perfect?
like you?
look!
here is your perfection!
no.
no. no. no.
oh, god.
oh, god.
there's no need
to panic.
i can fix this.
no, you won't fix anything.
it's over it's finished.
it's finished!
[groans]
[groans]
when i said you should
screw yourself, i didn't mean
for you to take it literally.
go after him.
just get him.
[security guard]
check the roof.
you, you, up top!
[guard]
he's goin' up!
he's goin' up the stairs!
come on!
 can you fly this?
 better than you can.
good. because
your shooting sucks.
let's get out of here.
[glass cracking]
[yelling]
[yelling]
oh, shit!
come on! come on!
try to climb over me!
come on! hurry up!
shit!
come on!
oh, shit!
you know, i keep wondering.
am i really human?
do i have a soul?
well, your d.n.a. scan
came back normal.
didn't it?
yeah.
zero defects.
just like a repet commercial.
well, if you're not human,
don't you think
they would've mentioned it?
all right, enough philosophy.
i better get going.
i got three weeks at sea
to figure that out.
you have to hurry
if you want to see clara.
oh, thanks for letting me
say goodbye to your family.
now, wait.
this is your family too.
you were willing to die
to save them.
think about that while
you're out at sea wondering
if you're really human or not.
because if that's
not being human,
i don't know what is.
thanks.
hello, everybody.
look what i brought.
a kitty!
oh, sadie. oh.
i thought that, um,
hank's cat was...
she is.
but you hate repets.
well, i changed my mind.
you old softie.
can we keep her?
please? please?
of course.
that's why i brought her home.
put her down. good.
thank you so much!
with my pleasure

i want a car
chicks dig the car
this is why superman works alone.
do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!
don't wait up, al.
i'll cancel the pizzas.
batman,
a new villain has commandeered
the gotham museum.
he's frozen
the antiquities wing.
he's turned
the security guards into ice.
he's calling himself, mr freeze. 
mr freeze.
stop! drop your weapon...
...or we'll shoot!
the iceman cometh.
please, show some mercy.
mercy?!
i'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.
in this universe...
...there's only one absolute.
everything...
...freezes.
hi, freeze.
i'm batman.
you're not sending me to the cooler

it's the hockey team from hell.
get the ice...
...i'll get the iceman.
thanks.
sweet.
i got mine.
where's yours?
what killed the dinosaurs?
the ice age!
hit me, boys.
thanks for playing.
i was hoping you'd drop in.
watch the numbers...
...for they are
the harbingers of your doom.
can you feel it coming?
the icy cold of space.
at 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze...
...and beat no more.
after you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to gotham.
freeze, you're mad.
this capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.
freeze well.
who invited you?
i was hanging around.
i thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.
how about, nice to see you.
thanks for saving my life. 
a batbomb?
we must blow this up
before it turns gotham into a crater
now what, call a taxi?!
watch the first step!
surf's up!
gotcha!
cowabunga!
he's freezing the furnace!
i got him.
stay cool...
...birdboy.
can you be cold?
you have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.
will you chase the villain...
...or save him?
emotion makes you weak.
that's why this day is mine.
i'll kill you next time!
did we get him?
drats!
my experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again...
...but i still have hope for
the animalplant crossbreedings.
if i can only find
the right dose of venom...
...these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.
i will have given flora...
...a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.
personal note:
my work would proceed faster..
...if dr woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...
...back to his mysterious
gilgamesh wing.
why won't he let me in the lab?
what is he doing in there?
ladies and gentlemen
of the ununited nations...
...and...
...our mystery bidder..
...may i present...
...antonio diego...
...serial murderer, serving life...
...in prison...
...and sole surviving...
...volunteer
and what a charmer he is.
by merely drilling three
concentric holes directly...
...into antonio's cranial cavity...
i have...
...created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain...
...the limbic system.
and now i add...
...my supersoldier serum...
...codenamed...
... venom ...
...to which i add
my very own recipe of steroids...
...and toxins.
plug him in.
time to scream.
genius!
behold...
...the ideal killing machine!
i call this little number..
... bane. 
bane of humanity!
imagine it.
your own private army made up of
thousands of these supersoldiers.
bidding begins at a mere...
... 10 million!
turbo!
show off for daddy.
dr isley.
welcome to my parlor
what?
you monster!
how could you?!
our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.
he cut the funding for our work.
without your research...
...i couldn't have come this far
join me.
the two of us,
entwined, side by side.
join you?
i have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...
...and now you...
...corrupt my research...
...into some maniacal scheme for
world domination.
when i get through...
...you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.
do you hear me?!
you psycho!
well...
...i can respect your opinion.
sadly, i'm not good at rejection.
i'm afraid you'll have to die.
let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...
...deep into the earth
you love so much!
byebye, dear!
fellow maniacs...
...bidding...
...begins!
gotham university labs
security video, 2 years ago.
dr victor fries...
...2time olympic decathlete and nobel
prize winner for molecular biology.
after his wife
contracted a rare disease...
...macgregor's syndrome...
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.
now, here's where
everything goes north.
that's got to hurt.
that liquid is 50 below.
but, he survived somehow.
the cryosolution mutated his body.
what happened to his wife?
no one knows.
she's presumed dead.
freeze needs
extreme cold to survive.
his cryosuit uses diamondenhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees.
if it's ice the iceman wants....
coming, sir
yes, sir?
we need the wayne diamonds.
we going to trap a snowman?
yes, right after you spend
i made a mistake. i'm sorry.
it won't happen again.
you were reckless
and almost got killed.
i'm fine! see!
me, here, alive!
how we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?
how indeed?
he's overeager, he's impulsive.
i can't trust him not to get hurt.
perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.
don't tell me
you're on his side again.
despite all your talents...
...you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.
master dick...
...follows the same star as you...
...but gets there by his own course.
you must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.
i trust you, alfred.
but i shan't be here forever
good night, master bruce.
good night, alfred.
oh, dear, master bruce.
good gracious, what a tumble.
there's a brave boy.
yes, sir
i am so pleased you won the bidding,
your supreme ruthlessness.
we're making the final modifications
on bane right now.
we'll have a flawless supersoldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.
dr isley?
pamela?
you look great.
especially for a dead woman.
hello, jason.
i think i've had a change of heart.
or quite...
...literally...
...the animalplant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.
they replaced my blood with aloe...
...my skin with chlorophyll...
...and filled...
...my lips...
...with venom.
and, jason, one other thing.
i probably
should have mentioned this earlier..
...i'm...
...poison.
it's a jungle in here.
i am nature's arm...
...her spirit...
...her will!
hell, i am mother nature.
and the time has come...
...for plants to take back...
...the world so rightfully ours...
...because it's not nice...
...to fool with mother nature.
wayne enterprises. 
coming, bane, darling.
we've got a plane to catch.
i'm mr icicle
i'm mr ten below
sing! sing!
come on, sing!
louder! come on!
sing! sing! sing!
he's mr white christmas
louder!
he's mr icicle
freezy...
...i'm feeling hot.
i find that unlikely.
so my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry...
...i'd weather blizzards to have you.
you're the most perfect man
i've ever known.
let's heat things up.
my passion thaws
for my bride alone.
talk about your cold shoulder
frosty!
yeah, boss?
energy.
battling the bat
exhausted my power
but...
...i was successful nevertheless.
absolutely, boss.
one more giant diamond of this size...
...and my freezing engine
will be complete.
i will freeze the city.
then i will hold gotham ransom.
unless the city bows
to my demands...
...it's winter forever
in gotham.
the city fathers
will have no choice...
...but to give me the billions
i need to complete my research...
...so i can find a cure.
leave us.
sure, boss.
we need quality time.
soon we will be together
once more.
soon.
i'll get it.
i must've dozed off.
my sincerest apologies.
no apology necessary.
it's the first time it's happened
in thirty years.
please be looking for me.
actually, i'm looking for
alfred pennyworth.
uncle alfred!
my dear
oh, my dear..
...what a most wonderful surprise.
how did you manage
to come here all the way from england?
my dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.
uncle?
barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister margaret.
both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago.
uncle alfred's been supporting me
ever since.
you have?
secrets, al?
secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.
don't you think, sir?
i'm on break from
oxbridge academy,
alfred's alma mater
the new computer sciences division.
how'd you know?
says so on the patch on your sweater
what is it? it's beautiful.
you can say that again.
it's a competition racer
i've been fixing it up.
i'll show you how to ride it.
you certainly will not!
don't worry, uncle alfred.
i'm terrified of these things.
barbara, i hope you'll stay with us.
oh, i don't know.
all this luxury really isn't
my style, but...
...yeah, i'd love to.
then it's settled.
but, sir, we...
...we do get so busy here.
don't be silly.
after all, she's family.
uncle alfred?
i came to tuck you in.
you came to tuck me in?
that's quite a switch.
what're you working on?
i'm trying to find my brother,
your uncle wilfred.
he's first butler
to the maharajah of miranjapore.
but miranjapore is a floating court.
it travels through india.
i remember mom getting postcards.
so wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.
i don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.
i've been trying to reach him
with no success.
when one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.
i have the same picture of mom
by my bed.
peg?
my nickname for sweet margaret.
it's good to see you again.
i've missed you.
as i have you.
sleep well, child.
you sleep.
go to bed.
good morning, gotham.
it's gossip gerty reporting to you
direct from the gotham observatory...
... where billionaire bruce wayne,
chairman of wayne enterprises...
...is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.
gotham observatory, bane.
and step on it.
step.
my father told me, to succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it. 
so wayne enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...
... to gotham's
observatory restoration project.
with any luck...
...this telescope will give
future generations a chance...
...to follow their own stars.
brucy...
...is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?
yes. if you'll watch
these monitors right here.
satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.
from here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on earth...
...and through this
intricate network of satellites...
...reflect it back to our
very own gotham city for observation.
just don't point it at my bedroom.
brucy, you and the exquisite
julie madison...
...have been going out forever
are you going to tie the knot?
marriage?
marriage?
you want to give me a hand here?
bruce and i are recklessly in love.
and that's most certainly
enough for us...for now.
if you will follow me,
i'll show you the central control grid.
you're a lot of help.
miss, you need to stop.
move, fascist bulldog!
you need an appointment
no, i don't!
miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.
she has no pass, sir
little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, miss?
dr pamela isley.
doctor..
...what can i do for you?
actually, i already
work for you, or did.
your arboreal preservation project
in south america.
we cut our funding.
there was a conflict of ideologies.
dr woodrue was a lunatic.
i see you knew him.
yes. that lab burnt down last week.
i'm glad you escaped.
i have here a proposal showing
how wayne enterprises can immediately...
...cease all actions
that toxify our environment.
forget the stars,
look here at the earth...
...our mother, our womb.
she deserves your loyalty
and protection.
and yet, you spoil her lands...
...poison her oceans...
...blacken her skies!
you're killing her!
your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat...
...no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die.
acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.
people come first, dr isley.
mammals!
a day of reckoning is coming.
that's right.
the same plants and flowers
that saw you...
...crawl from the primordial soup...
...will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!
you must be new in town.
in gotham city...
...batman and robin protect us...
...even from plants and flowers.
maybe you'd like to meet them.
caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...
...a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.
just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.
thank you all for coming.
good day, doctor
batman and robin...
...militant arm
of the warmblooded oppressors...
...animal protectors of the status quo.
first...
...i'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.
and then gotham...
...will be mine...
...for the greening.
excuse me, chief.
i got something here
you might want to see.
i hate when people talk
during the movie.
one more diamond, my love.
one more.
bruce wayne. diamonds. 
very nice.
ladies and gentlemen...
...gossip gerty
of good morning gotham and i...
...welcome you
to the gem of the evening.
our own commissioner gordon...
...displaying...
...the famed heart of isis,
on loan...
...from the collection of my
close personal friend, bruce wayne.
think freeze will take the bait?
he'll be here.
...to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers...
...the famed diamond
draped around her neck.
let's start the bidding!
i'll give 10,000 for the orchid!
and i bid...
...30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!
boys, please...
...let's show some gusto!
hi, there.
and you are?
poison...
...poison ivy.
why not send junior home early?
i've got some wild oats to sow.
on the other hand...
...youth does have its advantages.
endurance, stamina.
forget the geriatric bat.
come, join me.
my garden needs tending.
i'll take it from here, pal.
wouldn't you like the earrings too?
some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.
i'll include an evening of my company
for the winner
i'll bring everything you see here...
...plus everything you don't.
i bid 50,000 dollars for poison ivy!
and i'll bid...
...500,000 dollars!
one million dollars.
2 million.
you don't have it. 3 million.
i'll borrow it from you. four
that's a utility belt, not a money belt.
never leave the cave without it.
you boys aren't going to start fighting
over little old me, now are you?
all right, everyone!
chill.
chill.
get the gun!
look at you!
let me guess.
plant girl?
vine lady?
hand over the diamond, garden gal...
...or i'll turn you into mulch.
pheromone dust...
...designed to heat...
...a man's blood.
doesn't work on the coldhearted.
if you please!
if you insist.
clever little clover
that's my exit cue.
thanks.
good night.
cool party!
commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.
miss ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in gotham.
that's not a man...
...that is a god.
enough monkey business.
we've got work to do.
monkey work.
you can't make the jump.
i can!
pull back!
i can make it!
redbird control codes.
disable engine.
don't do it to me! !
we won't make it!
it's a cold town.
i could've made that jump.
you could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.
the flying graysons were a team.
we had to trust each to do his job.
that's what being partners is about.
counting on someone is the way to win.
your head wasn't on the job.
it was on poison ivy.
maybe she wanted me instead of you.
that's your idea of friendship?
it's your rules.
it's your way, or the highway.
it's batman and robin,
not robin and batman.
i'm sick of it!
yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.
if you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.
this is no partnership.
you're never going to trust me!
dear brother wilfred...
...i have tried
every address i know for you.
i'm just praying this reaches you.
we have very little time.
batman monopolized the evening news.
congratulations on your
apprehension of mr freeze.
thanks.
thank you.
is there something wrong, sir?
am i pigheaded?
is it always...
...my way or the highway?
why, yes.
actually.
death and chance stole your parents...
...but rather than become a victim...
...you have done everything
in your power to control the fates.
for what is batman...
...if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?
an attempt to control...
...death itself?
but i can't, can i?
none of us can.
sorry. so sorry!
teach you that at oxbridge?
just a few judo lessons.
you know, london's kind of rough.
i suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?
couldn't resist.
it's just so beautiful.
i just took it out for a spin.
i'll clean it tomorrow.
all right?
sorry.
sorry.
good night.
drag him into the cold beam.
welcome home, frost face.
you're the common cold,
and we are the cure.
allow me to break the ice.
my name is freeze.
learn it well...
...for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.
all right, freezie, you can't live
outside the cold zone.
look at him stew.
get used to it.
you're going to be here a very long...
...long time.
sadly...
...you will not live to see it.
batface and birdbrain turned out
to be much more resistant...
...to my love dust
than expected.
no matter next time
i'll just give them a stronger dose.
they'll literally be dying for me.
turkish baths. 
this looks promising.
a fixerupper
but with a certain homey charm.
a minus!
current tenants.
hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.
hello, yourself.
you look good enough to eat.
that i am.
come and get me,
if you can.
with pleasure.
let's redecorate.
i've always hankered
for something on the water
what is this floor?
it took god seven days...
...to create paradise.
let's see if i can do better
good babies.
grow for mommy.
bane, darling...
...i found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.
a cool customer, yes.
icy demeanor..
...no question.
but i detect a certain ruthless charm
i may be able to use...
...to my advantage.
honey, clean up this mess.
we've got company coming.
honey.
company.
we've been going out
for over a year now and
okay, here it goes.
i want to spend my life with you.
i'm not the marrying kind.
there are things about me
you wouldn't understand.
i know you're a dedicated bachelor
you've had your wild nights.
wild doesn't quite cover it.
you'll make someone
a good husband one day, but i can't wait forever
look, i don't want to pressure you.
because if i do you'll just shut down.
i know the way you are.
think about it.
just promise me you'll think about it.
okay?
you don't have to answer now.
just think it over
here's food for thought.
who's ivy?
you just called me ivy. 
who's ivy?
i wish i knew.
enhance detail, 14 to 19.
who are you?
gotcha!
banker, how much coin to play?
you're the chick who won
the tunnel run 2 nights ago!
that'd be me.
that was kid stuff, sweetheart.
why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?
want a side bet?
how much?
how much you got?
how much you got?
all right, let's race! come on!
just make sure the guys are ready
at the end of the bridge.
you got it, spike!
out of my way, losers!
nice try, girlie!
you're next!
excuse me!
look out, baby!
not bad, for a chick!
now!
end of the line, sweetheart!
so this is where you hang out.
how long you been racing?
since my parents died.
i guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.
made the pain go away.
you wouldn't understand.
you'd be surprised.
street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at oxbridge so...
...they kicked me out.
but i've already won the money i need
to do what i've always dreamed.
don't say you want to join the circus.
alfred has supported me my whole life
and i'm going to pay him back.
i'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude.
what are you talking about?
listen, this whole
masterservant thing...
...it's really ridiculous.
alfred is a sweet, noble man...
...and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.
alfred and bruce are like family.
paying someone to prepare your meals...
...do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?
alfred's happy.
happy?
you honestly don't know, do you?
how he's hiding the pain all the time.
alfred's sick.
alfred's not sick.
he's dying.
dying?
why didn't he tell us?
you know alfred,
he'd never say anything.
but i can tell.
i can't believe it.
i know.
icehead, you got a visitor
your sister is here to see you.
sister?
brother, dear..
...i heard you were blue.
don't mind us, ma'am.
you can speak freely.
i don't mind you at all.
men...
...the most absurd of god's creatures.
we give you life...
...and we can take it away
just as easily.
right!
whatever
i really am to die for
impressive!
well, i, my most
unabominable snowman...
...have been impressed by you.
in fact...
...i propose a pairing.
i've come to set you free.
an enticing offer..
...but...
...what does the lady want in return?
let's cool it for now.
i've got someone i want you to meet.
his name is bane.
a laundry service that delivers! wow!
what are you,
about a 50, big and tall?
no, i always go a size smaller
makes me look slimmer
i'm running on empty.
i need the diamonds.
i'll help you grab your rocks.
bane...
...dear..
...an exit, please.
reinforced steel.
not good.
always winterize your pipes.
while i get my diamonds,
you and meatloaf retrieve my wife.
you never mentioned a wife!
come on.
i hope mr bane can swim.
alfred, are you well?
as well as can be expected, sir
my friend, i know you're sick.
i can get you the best doctors.
i have seen the best doctors.
a gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. it is not civilized.
i hope that i have taught you
at least that much, master bruce.
have you ever..
...regretted your life working here?
looking after heroes?
no, sir
my only regret is that i was never
able to be out there with you.
not all the heroes wear masks.
freeze has escaped!
we got this off
the arkham surveillance camera.
poison ivy.
...gotham airport, these two arrive
by charter from south america.
they put 10 security guards
in the hospital...
...left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.
this is definitely the same pair
that sprang freeze.
excuse me, gentlemen.
poison ivy...
why would she help freeze?
she's definitely evil.
she was all i could think about,
like i was in love
i know, then the feeling vanished.
i can't believe
we fought over a bad guy.
bad, yes. guy, no.
well, i'm totally over her
me too. definitely.
great stems, though.
buds too.
those are nice.
here we go.
it's nora fries.
she's still alive.
he adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.
he found a cure for the disease
in some stages.
there she is.
get the diamonds.
i'll rescue the bride.
we'll meet back at my place.
in my weakened condition,
i'm no match for the bat and bird.
you leave those boys to me.
go!
can he save her?
her case is too advanced.
but maybe someday...
...with more research....
poison ivy.
i hate uninvited guests.
my lungs are freezing!
chilled...
...to perfection.
no beauty.
just the beast.
hey, there, pretty birdie.
give yourself up. if you surrender
to you?
polly want a kiss?
there's something about
an anatomically correct...
...rubber suit
that puts fire in a girl's lips.
why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? is it me?
enough...
...sweet talk.
first you'll tell me where freeze is,
then you're going to jail.
i'm a lover, not a fighter
that's why every poison ivy
action figure comes with him!
try not to make a mess when you die.
hold it right there!
stop!
living in the shadow
of the big, bad bat.
you don't need him.
you're the star
i can see it now:
your own big, bright signal in the sky.
let me guide you.
let me kiss you.
stop! don't kiss her
the victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.
what are you saying?
why does she want to kiss us?
i bet her lips are poisoned.
poisoned kiss?
you have issues with women!
you can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.
something would be mine, not yours.
exit, bane.
exit!
ivy's right. i don't need your help.
i'm going solo!
what happened?
how'd they get away?
i've never been good with competition.
who needs a frigid wife anyway?
make yourself right at home.
where's my wife?
there was nothing i could do.
batman deactivated her
she's dead.
you lie!
i'm sorry.
their bones will turn to ice!
their blood will freeze in my hands!
kill them, of course.
but why stop there?
why should only
batman and robin die...
...while the society that created them
goes unpunished?
yes!
if i must suffer..
...humanity will suffer with me!
i shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.
i will blanket the city
in endless winter!
first...
...gotham.
and then...
...the world!
just what i had in mind.
everything dead on earth except us.
a chance for..
...mother nature to start again.
behold...
...the dawn of a new age.
my mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.
once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.
and we shall rule them.
for we will be...
...the only two people
left in the world.
yes.
adam...
...and evil.
you distract the bat and bird...
...while i prepare...
...to freeze...
...gotham!
it's stage 1 of macgregor's syndrome.
i'm sorry.
all we can do is
make him comfortable.
thank you, doctor
macgregor's syndrome is
what fries' wife had.
alfred's condition is less severe.
fries' research said...
...he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.
no one else is even close.
i'm late for the dedication,
then i go after freeze and ivy alone.
like hell you do.
don't push me right now.
or what? no one can
capture ivy but the big, bad bat?
right.
you want her for yourself.
i want her so badly, i can taste it.
that's the whole point.
she's done something to us.
she has us fighting over her somehow.
i know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.
that's why you
stopped us from kissing.
you're not thinking straight.
but i am.
for the first time in a long time.
i want a robin signal
in the sky, all right?
i'm tired of living
in your shadow.
all that ends now.
i'm sorry, uncle.
i was too late.
you must do something for me.
find my brother, wilfred...
...your uncle,
wherever he is, and give him...
...this.
i have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.
only family can be trusted.
what is it?
it is a sacred trust of two good men...
...whom i have the honor
of calling son. 
take it to wilfred...
...and i implore you...
...never open it.
you look so like your mother
bonsoir, glamorous gothamites.
everyone who's anyone...
...has flocked to the observatory...
...and tonight's starstudded
dedication of the new telescope.
and here's the man
of the hour himself...
...bruce wayne.
excuse me.
commissioner
how are you?
good. you know julie?
how are you?
good to see you.
young man.
lovely to see you again.
thank you.
commissioner gordon...
...i've always wondered...
...where does that big,
old batlight come from?
why...
...it's...
...on top of police headquarters.
i'd just...
...love to see it.
but you probably don't have access.
why, dear lady...
...i am the police commissioner
i have the keys
right here in my pocket.
would you like to see it?
who are you, dear lady?
on second thought,
you're way too old for me.
no, i'm not.
please...
...come back.
what are you doing? come on.
show me how the satellites work.
first...
...i will turn gotham into
an icy graveyard...
...then...
...i will pull batman's heart
from his body...
...and feel it freeze in my hands.
revenge!
quickly, bane.
quickly now.
let there be light.
only family can be trusted?
i'm family.
access denied.
access denied.
i spend my entire life
trying to beat back death.
everything i've done,
everything i'm...
...capable of doing....
but i can't save you.
there's no defeat in death...
...master bruce.
victory comes in defending...
...what we know is right...
...while we still live.
i love you, old man.
and i love you too.
access denied.
this better be one hell of a secret.
margaret.
peg.
access allowed.
the combined power of
the telescope's reflecting crystals...
...will complete...
...my freezing engine.
no matter
what they tell you, mr bane...
...it is the size of
your gun that counts.
where are you going?
it's not a batlight, it's a robin signal.
ivy's calling me.
her name's pamela isley.
she must've stolen gordon's keys
and changed the signal.
she did it for me, for love.
she infected us with pheromones.
i'm under some kind of magic spell?
she wants to kill you.
you'd say anything to keep her
away from me.
to keep her for yourself.
you said being a team
means trusting your partner
sometimes, counting on someone
else is the only way to win. remember?
you weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family.
so i'm asking you...
...friend, partner..
...brother..
...will you trust me now?
all the crystals are in place.
thank you.
hi!
i'm sorry about the door
is the party over?
who is this nutball?
if revenge...
...is a dish best served cold...
...then put on your sunday finest.
it's time...
...to feast!
tonight...
...hell freezes over
intruder alert.
intruder alert.
intruder alert. identify.
uncle alfred, it's me. barbara.
i expected you might find
your way down here, child.
i programmed my brain algorithms...
...into the batcomputer..
...and created a virtual simulation.
i'd like to help batman and robin.
i anticipated you would...
...and took the liberty
to create something in your size.
suit me up, uncle alfred.
hi there.
is your thumb the
only part of you that's green?
you will just have to find out.
i want us to be together, but...
...you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.
i need a sign...
how about slippery when wet. 
...of trust.
tell me your plan.
kiss me and i'll tell you.
tell me and i'll kiss you.
freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.
he's about to turn gotham
into an ice cube.
i've got to stop him.
one kiss...
...my love.
for luck.
bad luck, i'm afraid.
time to die, little robin.
i hate to disappoint you, but...
...rubber lips are immune to
your charms.
see you!
you're not the only one
who can set a trap, venus.
sorry...
...my vines have a crush on you.
got to go.
so many people to kill,
so little time.
you're about to become compost.
using feminine wiles
to get what you want?
trading on your looks?
read a book.
that passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.
you give women a bad name.
as i told lady fries,
when i pulled her plug...
...this is a one-woman show.
i don't think so.
curses!
freeze is going to ice the city.
i know.
and you are?
batgirl.
that's not p.c. what about
batperson or batwoman?
bruce, it's me, barbara.
i found the batcave.
we must change the locks.
she knows who we are.
we must kill her
later we have work to do.
let's kick some ice.
we have 11 minutes
to thaw the city.
gotcha!
now!
shield.
i'll finish off the city.
you kill the kids, but...
...leave me the bat.
no sign of the snowman.
maybe he melted.
no, he's just hibernating.
these heaters will thaw them.
i hope you've got
and they're ice cubes forever
sunlight could reverse
the freezing process.
sunrise isn't for 5 hours.
here.
it's morning in the congo.
we'll relay sunlight
from below the equator
it'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but....
damn!
damn?
damn's not good.
those targeting mirrors are frozen.
i realign, you thaw the mirrors.
tonight's forecast:
a freeze is coming.
byebye.
i got you!
no.
i got you.
it's one of those days!
dirty fighter!
the tube!
yay, batman!
hey, freeze.
the heat is on.
you all right down there?
here goes.
hang on.
you're doing it!
you've lost, freeze.
i think not.
bombs away, batman.
freeze in hell, batman!
what should we do now?
pray.
hang on!
grab on to my belt!
thank you, batman!
need a ride?
most of gotham's still frozen.
it's midnight.
telescope's gone.
there's no way to thaw the city.
the satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.
i'm on it.
no, i'm on it.
have to do it upside down.
men!
everything the hard way.
you're pretty good at this, little girl.
watch and learn, little boy.
they say it'll be a beautiful day.
i'm taking you back
to arkham asylum.
go on.
kill me too.
just as you killed my wife.
i didn't kill your wife.
as i told lady fries
when i pulled her plug...
... this is a one-woman show.
but she's not dead.
we found her,
restored her
she's still frozen alive...
...waiting for you to find a cure.
she lives?
but vengeance isn't power
anyone can take a life.
but to give life...
...that's true power
a power you once had.
she's alive.
so i'm asking you.
victor fries...
...help me save another life.
show me how to cure
macgregor's syndrome stage 1.
and maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.
he's still inside you, victor
buried...
...deep beneath the snow.
will you help me...
...doctor?
take 2 of these...
...and call me in the morning.
i'll have your wife
moved to the lab at arkham.
you'll be able to continue
your research there.
all we can do now is wait...
...and hope.
he loves me.
he loves me not.
he loves me.
not!
surprise.
i'm your new cellmate.
and i've come
to make your life a living hell.
prepare...
...for a bitter harvest.
winter..
...has come at last.
are you...?
rather disappointed at how poorly
i have taught you proper housekeeping.
and quite well, it seems!
thanks to you, son.
thanks to you all.
well done, bruce.
you too.
well done.
i got one question.
when we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?
it's the first time i've fallen
and you weren't there.
i figured you could handle it.
you know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.
excuse me.
i'm the one who
kicked ivy's botanical butt.
yeah, that was me.
i did it all by myself.
that was me.
you are going back to school.
you'll never win this argument.
partners?
partners.
partners.
we're going to need a bigger cave.

you couldn't hide, johnny!
nobody hides from us!
shit!
get me ice. i broke my goddamn hand.
sure, boss.
fuck you!
just do me!
sure, johnny. but first...
...mr canelli wants a little souvenir
open up!
open up!
we'll send this to your
witness protection buddies.
see if it sings on its own.
they can take it to the trial.
open up!
benny?
who the hell are you?
close your eyes.
who are you?!
shut up!
you too!
it's okay.
do what he says.
don't move. you're dead.
i need the clothes you're wearing.
your ring.
your watch.
all your ids.
now.
do it!
come with me.
grab the other one.
let's go.
put your clothes on them. move!
there's been a murder
at 232 alden drive.
send the police.
they killed you, then
turned on each other
right.
you sonsofbitches.
shit!
this doesn't work without an audience.
outside. let's go.
get in.
thank you.
thank you. anything you
ever need, just ask me.
you endangered your life and
the u.s. marshals protecting you.
what?
you went to your old restaurant.
you went back to gennaro's?
johnny, are you stupid?!
it's the osso buco.
i was fucking dying for a decent meal!
next time, you're dead!
this only happens once.
get out.
that was our ride!
let's go.
go.
you won't see me again.
but i'll know your every move.
use your heads, lie low
and no one will hurt you.
skip out on your testimony and i'll
deliver you to the canelli family.
i promise.
i owe you big time. i'm a
standup guy, you got it?
you ever need anything, you
let me know. what's your name?
honey, he doesn't want to be pen pals.
smile. you've just been erased.
john, would you look at something?
one is from our shop, the others
are real. what do you think?
that's the fake.
who the hell is that?
if i tell you, i'd have to kill you.
shut up and run this again.
with a little sleight of hand...
...one very dead john doe trades
places with one very live scumbag.
robert, sit down.
you know...
...if god was as forgiving as witsec...
...hell would be one empty joint.
god doesn't have our court system.
i understand you had a busy night.
a witness got careless.
i see.
i had to defuse the situation.
and that included breaking
into the county morgue?
someone taught me that improvisation
is the heart of field work.
it was you.
in the old days. weather's changed.
now every asshole in
congress is down our backs.
i'm telling you to walk softly.
that's why beller called me in?
because of the morgue?
no, no, no.
he doesn't know anything about that.
i don't think he has to.
shadow ops still has some privileges.
you're right.
john...
...good work.
i had a good teacher
bullshit.
you had the best.
under witsec protection...
...and not one with a profile like this.
that bad?
that good. this young
lady, miss cullen...
...is a real live, bona fide...
...honest person.
then why does she need us?
she's a senior executive
at cyrez corporation.
they're major defense contractors.
topsecret weapons research.
looks like someone inside
cyrez is selling out uncle sam.
feds need her to prove their case.
she's the key witness in the
hottest scandal since lrancontra.
when does this go down?
tomorrow.
the sting's in place.
when it's over, she's all yours.
sealed file on relocate.
your eyes only.
as usual, only you and i will be privy
to the exact location of your witness.
but, john...
...there are some serious
players in washington...
...who could be badly burned.
so could she.
welcome to cyrez corporation.
morning, dave.
she's in.
anything yet?
not yet.
that's right, lady. we're right here.
we're on.
hear me?
we hear you.
i look okay?
tell her she looks great.
not bad, miss cullen.
not bad for an amateur
we're right with you.
yeah.
then let's do it.
good morning, miss cullen.
good morning.
station c?
yes.
and how long today?
okay.
you're doing just fine, lee.
hope we bought the right combination.
bingo!
shit!
it's okay. we lose
transmission in the vault.
what now?
now we wait.
she's only got 5 minutes
till the shift change.
what's taking so long?
sweetheart, you've got 2 minutes left.
shouldn't have used her
shit! she's out of time.
welcome back, lee. we're with you.
miss cullen...
...mr donahue would like to see you.
in a minute.
he said right now.
what's going on?
they made us.
check the directory.
where's donahue's office?
i know.
get ready to roll. it could go south.
what is it, william?
someone i trusted for 5 years.
someone i told others could be trusted.
i was pulling
don't!
we're way beyond bullshit here.
who do you work for?
shit, we're dead.
i should ask you that question.
i thought it was for the u.s.
government.
come on, lee.
what do you think we do here?
this isn't the red cross.
we make weapons.
things that kill people.
if the government won't pay the cost...
...it's my job to find someone who will.
treason is part of the
corporate strategy?
i asked who you were working for
you didn't tell me.
my god.
holy shit.
christ.
get her out of there.
what is this?
a camera?
for the fbl, william.
they heard everything you just said.
they're watching us now.
and you think that makes you safe?
you...
...have no fucking idea!
how could you do this to me?
i hope you understand, lee.
you leave me no choice.
wait a minute! stop her!
stop! hey!
go, go, go!
hard evidence.
it's all yours, gentlemen.
we've handled these situations before.
you haven't answered my question.
we told you there'd be risks.
you told me i'd have complete
protection the entire time.
it didn't go as smoothly
as we anticipated.
that's an understatement.
remember, miss cullen, you came to us.
i came to you with a clerical error
you asked for my help.
and we got it.
if cyrez sells weapons' technology,
that's high treason.
this disk and your testimony will put
all the coconspirators behind bars.
you've done a great
service for your country.
it's time to think about your safety.
this is u.s. marshal john kruger,
witness protection program.
he'll handle your personal security.
my protection?
your new identity, relocation.
i'll take you through it stepbystep.
what are you talking about?
i'm not going anywhere.
you're in an extremely
highrisk situation.
wasn't it explained to you?
your boss was just a middleman, lee.
there are more dangerous
people involved.
you expect me to give up my whole life?
until the trial. then you're
completely out of danger
and how do you know that?
how do you know?
look, i will keep up my end of
the bargain. i will testify.
but that's it.
i'm going home.
put people on her right away...
...or we'll need a seance
for her testimony.
who brought her into this?
she volunteered. she had
security clearance....
you told her it's a walk in the park.
when she finds out her life isn't
her own anymore, it's too late.
we had no case without her
it's easier to put her ass on
the line than yours, isn't it?
sully.
frediano, how you doing?
good. have something for you.
let's see.
your receipt.
gentlemen, always a pleasure.
it's me.
your music has arrived.
get mr morehart down here.
it's me.
lee?
i heard about donahue. are you okay?
i'm fine.
i shouldn't have trusted them.
of course not. the feds are idiots.
they'll blow the case or bury it.
the feds are here.
they're watching.
let me write this story and i'll
nail cyrez all over the front page.
it may not be safe to
talk on this phone.
i'll call you.
wait. did you make a copy?
yeah.
that's your insurance, lee.
go public. they don't dare touch you.
lee, what's wrong?
i don't know. i got to go.
hi, baby.
what are you doing here?
waiting for you. how are you doing?
so you just let yourself into my house?
i've worried about you.
i haven't heard from you in days.
there's nothing to talk about.
it's over
you know that.
come on.
that doesn't hurt you to say that?
it hurt me 3 months ago.
but after the phone calls, after
the notes on my car, and tonight...
...it's getting a lot easier
get down.
who're you seeing?
come on, darryl.
i know you're seeing someone.
let's see who that is.
what's this?
and a card.
get down!
oh, shit! go, go, go!
come here!
stay down.
i don't have a shot.
you, go, go.
what are you doing?
lighting a fuse.
are you hit?
are you bleeding?
i don't think so.
are they following us?
no. just calm down.
you'll be fine.
i'm not fine.
they tried to kill me!
darryl's dead.
you're alive.
keep you that way.
your hand.
there's a first aid kit under your seat.
that weapon, or whatever it was...
...was from your company, wasn't it?
it's an e.m. prototype.
it's not supposed to exist.
e.m.?
electromagnetic pulse.
no gunpowder, no conventional bullets.
they fire aluminum rounds at
almost the speed of light.
a rail gun.
yeah, that's another name for them.
the navy's worked on them for years.
the smallest one i've heard of
is mounted on a battleship.
cyrez was contracted
to scale them down...
...to design a compact
hypervelocity, pulse weapon...
...most powerful assault rifle on earth.
they took millions, then
said it was impossible.
they looked real enough to me.
maybe cyrez found a higher bidder
they're connected everywhere:
defense, cia, nsa...
...maybe even your people.
still want to put them away?
yes.
i'll hide you until the hearings.
no one will know where.
not my boss, not witsec.
no one.
can you do that?
the feds knew it'd be a death sentence
for you, and let you walk right into it.
i'm stupid.
you trusted them, that's all.
now, trust me.
this is morehart.
we have a problem.
go ahead. this line's secure.
the cullen woman is still alive.
are you serious?
it gets worse.
she has a disk.
she tried to access our program with it.
do you have any idea the risk
i took to get this back?!
i know. she must have made a duplicate.
then get it.
whatever it takes!
understood.
one other thing.
i checked her phone records.
and?
she called a woman named lsaacs.
a reporter for the washington herald.
i see.
you know what has to be done.
do it.
the joint chiefs are ready.
i'll be right there. thank you.
that's it. that's everything i am.
that's nothing.
it's a few numbers and some plastic.
what you are is in here.
no one can take that from you.
they'll try.
we'll stop them.
i need the rest.
that's all.
no. this.
this?
it's st. george.
it's silly, but when i was a kid i
used to have nightmares about dragons.
he watched over you.
yeah.
well, that's my job now.
get some sleep.
we leave at dawn.
okay.
night.
there's a place i know where
it's easy to disappear
there's a woman there i helped.
she testified against the
yakuza bosses in san francisco.
her new name is meiling.
you'll be safe with
her until the hearings.
your new name is deborah elliott.
you think of me as a deborah?
i don't know.
i could have used
something more fun, like...
...debbie?
deb?
deborah's fine.
aaa credit.
what's my limit?
it is not a license to shop.
i want you to lay low right now.
meiling will take care of you.
you know the signal.
go straight to the pay
phone and wait for my call.
it's a public place, with
and...
...l work alone.
if anyone comes to you
and claims i sent them...
...use this.
you just pull the trigger
i guess i won't see you again.
if everything goes well...no.
at least not until the trial.
thanks.
thank me when it's over
undersecretary of defense daniel harper..
...spoke before congress
today about the cyrez scandal.
private contractors are
within parameters...
...of defense department spending.
i look forward to the cyrez
hearing. i'm confident...
...we'll be vindicated of
mismanagement of funds.
thank you, mr chairman,
for the opportunity.
thanks for coming.
you know i don't like
meeting outside of work.
it's not my choice.
are they with you?
yeah.
whether i like it or not....
listen, john...
...we've got a problem.
what's up?
someone's murdering our witnesses.
we've got 3 confirmed
kills in the last 48 hours.
who?
not one of yours.
not one of mine. not yet.
did they break cover?
no.
no, that is the problem.
and there's no way anyone could
know all 3 of their locations.
there's a mole inside witsec.
beller thinks so. he may be right.
all 3 singers were witnesses in
some high profile federal cases.
all with international ties.
that's our common thread.
other singers fit the profile.
six.
one's yours and one's mine. so...
...we have to replant them immediately.
the jet is fueling as we speak.
i work alone.
you know that.
not today.
beller's orders.
buddy system, cia escorts...
...3 teams. we're one of them.
fine.
we do yours first.
this is john kruger
these are agents schiff and calderon.
i forgot which is which.
i'm schiff.
and i'm calderon.
know her?
should l?
she was reporting on cyrez.
it could be connected to your witness.
did someone take her out?
peeled her like an onion.
if she knew anything, she talked.
this here is deputy monroe.
he's one of ours.
monroe, you're looking at
a legend: mr john kruger
deputy.
sir, it's a pleasure.
nice rig.
how many of these you got?
three.
different parts of the country.
handy for quick relocates. sometimes
we run violent felons for the feds.
chauffeurs for degenerates.
don't you get tired of babysitting scum?
yeah.
but in your case, we'll
make an exception.
who the hell does he think he is?
he thinks he's the best guy in the game.
i think he's right.
try not to piss him off.
you're east.
you're west.
you're north. here.
we've got the boathouse,
garage, back door
front entrance.
you and me, buddy.
i don't want to get shot today.
keep your safeties on.
we'll find her inside baking muffins.
this is my witness.
her name is allison.
she's a very nice lady.
so let's bring her out safely.
here you go.
let's go, big guy.
the engine's still warm.
shut up!
you're early.
you're late.
hush, now.
he won't hurt you anymore.
get an ambulance!
go on!
sorry, honey.
we lost her
why send 5 men to kill one woman?
they were waiting for us.
we've been set up.
yours?
call her
no phones. we must livecontact her
where is she?
atlanta.
let's move, then.
here. you'll like this better
you all right?
i think so, sir
first time under fire?
it's okay to be shaky.
hell, i'm shaky.
the thing is, sir..
i don't know what i feel.
it was terrible and exciting at the same time?
nothing to be ashamed of.
it's perfectly natural.
tell him.
it's natural.
the game's that way.
like a drug. you get hooked,
there's no turning back.
take me.
my old man...
...a little nobody in d.c.
nice quiet guy.
anyway, on his deathbed...
...he tells me that all those
years he was working for the cia.
i had to be part of that world.
i joined the cia, couple of years...
now i'm at witsec.
hey, buddy.
what about you, sir?
why did you join witsec?
sir, is something wrong?
answer the kid.

i was supposed to give it to
a friend of mine, a reporter
she asked me
claire isaacs?
how do you know?
she's dead.
they killed her
how could they have known?
i didn't tell anyone.
i know. it's not your fault.
maybe they tapped her phone.
there's many ways....
everything's going to be all right.
i was just trying to cover myself.
i didn't know who i can trust.
now, i'll get us both killed.
no.
this may be all that keeps us alive.
i don't even know what's on that.
we'll see.
it's completely hackerproof.
there's no way to run it outside cyrez.
then we'll run it from the inside.
it's like a fortress. we can't go
back there. they'd expect that.
i'd hate to disappoint them.
the streets are clear the police
are safely back in their donut shops.
this is father rodriguez.
pleasure.
i was not always father rodriguez.
i was born again, with a
little help from our friend.
his columbian associates wanted to
introduce him to god personally.
i've been given a second chance at life.
this time, i'm using it for god's work.
anything else i can do?
we need a car just for a day or two.

hello?
it's for you.
you've just been erased.
oh, my god!
let me out!
break it!
get off of me!
what happened.
they caught a train.

what a greeting!
this is like winning an oscar! ...as if i would know! speaking of acting, one of my movies was called true lies. it's what the democrats should have called their convention.
my fellow americans, this is an amazing moment for me. to think that a once scrawny boy from austria could grow up to become governor of california and stand in madison square garden to speak on behalf of the president of the united states. that is an immigrant's dream. it is the american dream.
i was born in europe ...and i've traveled all over the world. i can tell you that there is no place, no country, more compassionate, more generous, more accepting and more welcoming than the united states of america.
as long as i live, i will never forget that day 21 years ago when i raised my hand and took the oath of citizenship.
do you know how proud i was? i was so proud that i walked around with an american flag around my shoulders all day long.
tonight, i want to talk about why i'm even more proud to be an american  why i'm proud to be a republican and why i believe this country is in good hands.
when i was a boy, the soviets occupied part of austria. i saw their tanks in the streets. i saw communism with my own eyes. i remember the fear we had when we had to cross into the soviet sector growing up, we were told, don't look the soldiers in the eye. look straight ahead. it was a common belief that soviet soldiers could take a man out of his own car and ship him off to the soviet union as slave labor
my family didn't have a car  but one day we were in my uncle's car it was near dark as we came to a soviet checkpoint. i was a little boy, i wasn't an action hero back then, and i remember how scared i was that the soldiers would pull my father or my uncle out of the car and i'd never see him again. my family and so many others lived in fear of the soviet boot. today, the world no longer fears the soviet union and it is because of the united states of america!
as a kid i saw the socialist country that austria became after the soviets left. i love austria and i love the austrian people  but i always knew america was the place for me. in school, when the teacher would talk about america, i would daydream about coming here. i would sit for hours watching american movies transfixed by my heroes like john wayne. everything about america seemed so big to me so open, so possible.
i finally arrived here in 1968. i had empty pockets, but i was full of dreams. the presidential campaign was in full swing. i remember watching the nixon and humphrey presidential race on tv. a friend who spoke german and english, translated for me. i heard humphrey saying things that sounded like socialism, which is what i had just left. but then i heard nixon speak. he was talking about free enterprise, getting government off your back, lowering taxes and strengthening the military. listening to nixon speak sounded more like a breath of fresh air
i said to my friend, what party is he? my friend said, he's a republican. i said, then i am a republican! and i've been a republican ever since! and trust me, in my wife's family, that's no small achievement! i'm proud to belong to the party of abraham lincoln, the party of teddy roosevelt, the party of ronald reagan and the party of george w bush.
to my fellow immigrants listening tonight, i want you to know how welcome you are in this party. we republicans admire your ambition. we encourage your dreams. we believe in your future. one thing i learned about america is that if you work hard and play by the rules, this country is truly open to you. you can achieve anything.
everything i have  my career, my success, my family  i owe to america. in this country, it doesn't make any difference where you were born. it doesn't make any difference who your parents were. it doesn't make any difference if, like me, you couldn't even speak english until you were in your twenties.
america gave me opportunities and my immigrant dreams came true. i want other people to get the same chances i did, the same opportunities. and i believe they can. that's why i believe in this country, that's why i believe in this party and that's why i believe in this president.
now, many of you out there tonight are republican like me in your hearts and in your beliefs. maybe you're from guatemala. maybe you're from the philippines. maybe europe or the ivory coast. maybe you live in ohio, pennsylvania or new mexico. and maybe, just maybe, you don't agree with this party on every single issue. i say to you tonight i believe that's not only okay, that's what's great about this country. here we can respectfully disagree and still be patriotic, still be american and still be good republicans.
my fellow immigrants, my fellow americans, how do you know if you are a republican? i'll tell you how.
if you believe that government should be accountable to the people, not the people to the government, then you are a republican! if you believe a person should be treated as an individual, not as a member of an interest group, then you are a republican! if you believe your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does, then you are a republican! if you believe our educational system should be held accountable for the progress of our children, then you are a republican! if you believe this country, not the united nations, is the best hope of democracy in the world, then you are a republican! and, ladies and gentlemen, if you believe we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism, then you are a republican!
 there is another way you can tell you're a republican. you have faith in free enterprise, faith in the resourcefulness of the american people, and faith in the u.s. economy. to those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy, i say: don't be economic girlie men!

the u.s. economy remains the envy of the world. we have the highest economic growth of any of the world's major industrialized nations. don't you remember the pessimism of 20 years ago when the critics said japan and germany were overtaking the u.s.? ridiculous!

now they say india and china are overtaking us. don't you believe it! we may hit a few bumps  but america always moves ahead! that's what americans do!

we move prosperity ahead. we move freedom ahead. we move people ahead. under president bush and vice president cheney, america's economy is moving ahead in spite of a recession they inherited and in spite of the attack on our homeland.

now, the other party says there are two americas. don't believe that either i've visited our troops in iraq, kuwait, bosnia, germany and all over the world. i've visited our troops in california, where they train before they go overseas. and i've visited our military hospitals. and i can tell you this: our young men and women in uniform do not believe there are two americas!

they believe we are one america and they are fighting for it! we are one america  and president bush is defending it with all his heart and soul!

that's what i admire most about the president. he's a man of perseverance.

he's a man of inner strength. he is a leader who doesn't flinch, doesn't waiver, does not back down. my fellow americans, make no mistake about it. terrorism is more insidious than communism, because it yearns to destroy not just the individual, but the entire international order the president didn't go into iraq because the polls told him it was popular as a matter of fact, the polls said just the opposite. but leadership isn't about polls. it's about making decisions you think are right and then standing behind those decisions. that's why america is safer with george w bush as president.

he knows you don't reason with terrorists. you defeat them. he knows you can't reason with people blinded by hate. they hate the power of the individual. they hate the progress of women. they hate the religious freedom of others. they hate the liberating breeze of democracy. but ladies and gentlemen, their hate is no match for america's decency.

we're the america that sends out peace corps volunteers to teach village children. we're the america that sends out missionaries and doctors to raise up the poor and the sick. we're the america that gives more than any other country, to fight aids in africa and the developing world. and we're the america that fights not for imperialism but for human rights and democracy.

you know, when the germans brought down the berlin wall, america's determination helped wield the sledgehammers. when that lone, young chinese man stood in front of those tanks in tiananmen square, america's hopes stood with him. and when nelson mandela smiled in election victory after all those years in prison, america celebrated, too.

we are still the lamp lighting the world especially for those who struggle. no matter in what labor camp they slave, no matter in what injustice they're trapped, they hear our call, they see our light, and they feel the pull of our freedom. they come here as i did because they believe. they believe in us.

they come because their hearts say to them, as mine did, if only i can get to america. someone once wrote: there are those who say that freedom is nothing but a dream. they are right. it's the american dream.

no matter the nationality, no matter the religion, no matter the ethnic background, america brings out the best in people. and as governor of the great state of california, i see the best in americans every day  our police, our firefighters, our nurses, doctors, and teachers, our parents.

and what about the extraordinary men and women who have volunteered to fight for the united states of america! i have such great respect for them and their heroic families.

let me tell you about the sacrifice and commitment i've seen firsthand. in one of the military hospitals i visited, i met a young guy who was in bad shape. he'd lost a leg had a hole in his stomach, his shoulder had been shot through.

i could tell there was no way he could ever return to combat. but when i asked him, when do you think you'll get out of the hospital? he said, sir, in three weeks. and do you know what he said to me then? he said he was going to get a new leg, and get some therapy, and then he was going back to iraq to serve alongside his buddies! he grinned at me and said, arnold, i'll be back!

ladies and gentlemen, america is back! back from the attack on our homeland, back from the attack on our economy, back from the attack on our way of life. we're back because of the perseverance, character and leadership of the 43rd president of the united states, george w bush.

my fellow americans, i want you to know that i believe with all my heart that america remains the great idea that inspires the world. it's a privilege to be born here. it's an honor to become a citizen here. it's a gift to raise your family here, to vote here and to live here.

our president, george w bush, has worked hard to protect and preserve the american dream for all of us. that's why i say, send him back to washington for four more years!

thank you, america, and god bless you all!

well, thank you very much. (applause) hello, everybody. what a great introduction, what a wonderful thing. what a great, great welcome i'm getting here, so thank you very much. i mean, i haven't heard applause like that since i announced that i was going to stop acting. (applause)
but anyway, it is really terrific to see here so many graduate students and undergraduate students graduating here today. i heard that there are 4,500 graduating here today, undergraduate students, so this is fantastic. there are 2,200 men, 2,300 women and five have listed yourselves as undecided. (applause)
so this is really a great, great bunch of people here, i love it. but seriously, president sample, trustees, faculty, family, friends and graduates, it is a tremendous privilege to stand before you this morning. there's nothing that i enjoy more than celebrating great achievements. and i don't just mean your parents celebrating never having to pay another tuition bill, that's not what i'm talking about.
i'm talking about just celebrating the great accomplishment. so let me congratulate the trojan class of 2009 on your graduation from one of the finest universities in the world. let's give our graduates a tremendous round of applause. what a special day, what a great accomplishment. (applause)
now, this an equally special day, of course, for the parents, for the grandparents, siblings and other family members whose support made all of this today possible. and let's not forget, of course, the professors, those dedicated individuals who taught you, who came up with exciting ways to share their vast wisdom, knowledge and experience with you.
and i must also say thank you to president sample for honoring me with this fantastic degree. thank you very much. wow, arnold schwarzenegger, doctor of humane letters. i love it. (applause) but, of course, i noticed that it wasn't a doctorate in film or in cinema or in acting. i wonder why?
but anyway, that's ok. i take whatever i can get. but maybe now since i'm the doctor, i can go back up to sacramento and maybe now the legislature will finally listen to me. (applause) but anyway, i stand before you today not just as dr. schwarzenegger or as governor schwarzenegger, or as the terminator, or as conan the barbarian, but also as a proud new member of this trojan family.
 now, some of you may know that my daughter just completed her freshman year right here. one of the most exciting things for me has been to learn about the great traditions that make this university so wonderful and so special.

my daughter told me all about, for instance, the victory bell. she sat me down and she told me it weighs 295 pounds and how the winner of the annual football game between usc and ucla takes this bell and gets to paint it in the school colors. and i stopped her in the middle of talking, i said, "wait a minute, katherine, back up a little bit. ucla has a football team?" (applause)

now, of course, my daughter's journey here at usc is just beginning, and yours is ending. i know that you're a little bit stressed out right now as you start this exciting new chapter in your lives. some people say it is scary to leave the comfort of the university and to go out into the cold, hard world.

but i have to tell you something; i think this is a bunch of nonsense because after all, this is america. this is the greatest country on earth, with the greatest opportunities. (applause) it is one thing if you were born in afghanistan or in swat valley in pakistan where you'd be forced to join the taliban or be killed. now, then i would say yes, that is a little bit scary.

but this, this is going to be a piece of cake for you, trust me. you live in america and you're prepared for the future with this tremendous education you have gotten here at one of the greatest universities in the world. this is going to be exciting, it's a great adventure and this is a new phase in your life. this is going to be awesome. (applause)

now, of course, this journey is not going to be without any setbacks, failures or disappointments. that's just the way life is. but you're ready and you are able, and you would not be here today with your degrees and with your honors if you wouldn't be ready.

so now, of course, to help you along the way, i thought that the best schwarzenegger gift i could give you today is to give you a few of my own personal ideas on how to be successful. and parents, i just want you to know, maybe you should close your ears, you should plug your ears, because maybe there a few things that you maybe won't like in what i have to say.

but anyway, i can explain how i became successful and who i am today by going through what i call dr. schwarzenegger's six rules of success. (applause)

now, of course, people ask me all the time, they say to me, "what is the secret to success?" and i give them always the short version. i say, "number one, come to america. number two, work your butt off. and number three, marry a kennedy." (applause)

but anyway, those are the short rules. now today, i'm going to give you the six rules of success. but before i start, i just wanted to say these are my rules. i think that they can apply to anyone, but that is for you to decide, because not everyone is the same. there are some people that just like to kick back and coast through life and others want to be very intense and want to be number one and want to be successful. and that's like me.

i always wanted to be very intense, i always wanted to be number one. i took it very seriously, my career. so this was the same when i started with bodybuilding. i didn't want to just be a bodybuilding champion, i wanted to be the best bodybuilder of all time. the same was in the movies. i didn't want to just be a movie star; i wanted to be a great movie star that is the highest paid movie star and have above-the-title billing.

and so this intensity always paid off for me, this commitment always paid off for me. so here are some of the rules.

the first rule is: trust yourself.

and what i mean by that is, so many young people are getting so much advice from their parents and from their teachers and from everyone. but what is most important is that you have to dig deep down, dig deep down and ask yourselves, who do you want to be? not what, but who.

and i'm talking about not what your parents and teachers want you to be, but you. i am talking about figuring out for yourselves what makes you happy, no matter how crazy it may sound to other people.

i was lucky growing up because i did not have television or didn't have telephones, i didn't have the computers and the ipods. and, of course, twitter was then something that birds did outside the window. i didn't have all these distractions and all this.

i spent a lot of time by myself, so i could figure out and listen to what is inside my heart and inside my head

and i recognized very quickly that inside my head and heart were a burning desire to leave my small village in austria -- not that there was something wrong with austria, it's a beautiful country. but i wanted to leave that little place and i wanted to be part of something big, the united states of america, a powerful nation, the place where dreams can come true.

i knew when i came over here i could realize my dreams. and i decided that the best way for me to come to america was to become a bodybuilding champion, because i knew that was ticket the instant that i saw a magazine cover of my idol, reg park. he was mr. universe, he was starring in hercules movies, he looked strong and powerful, he was so confident.

so when i found out how he got that way i became obsessed, and i went home and i said to my family, "i want to be a bodybuilding champion."

now, you can imagine how that went over in my home in austria. my parents, they couldn't believe it. they would have been just happy if i would have become a police officer like my father, or married someone like heidi, had a bunch of kids and ran around like the von trapp family in sound of music.

that's what my family had in mind for me, but something else burned inside me. something burned inside me. i wanted to be different; i was determined to be unique. i was driven to think big and to dream big. everyone else thought that i was crazy. my friends said, "if you want to be a champion in a sport, why don't you go and become a bicycle champion or a skiing champion or a soccer champion? those are the austrian sports."

but i didn't care. i wanted to be a bodybuilding champion and use that to come to america, and use that to go into the movies and make millions of dollars. so, of course, for extra motivation i read books on strongmen and on bodybuilding and looked at magazines. and one of the things i did was, i decorated my bedroom wall.

right next to my bed there was this big wall that i decorated all with pictures. i hung up pictures of strongmen and bodybuilders and wrestlers and boxers and so on. and i was so excited about this great decoration that i took my mother to the bedroom and i showed her. and she shook her head. she was absolutely in shock and tears started running down her eyes.

and she called the doctor, she called our house doctor and she brought him in and she explained to him, "there's something wrong here." she looked at the wall with the doctor and she said, "where did i go wrong? i mean, all of arnold's friends have pictures on the wall of girls, and arnold has all these men.

but it's not just men, they're half naked and they're oiled up with baby oil. what is going on here? where did i go wrong?" so you can imagine, the doctor shook his head and he said, "there's nothing wrong. at this age you have idols and you go and have those -- this is just quite normal."

so this is rule number one. i wanted to become a champion; i was on a mission. so rule number one is, of course, trust yourself, no matter how and what anyone else thinks.

rule number two is: break the rules.

we have so many rules in life about everything. i say break the rules. not the law, but break the rules. my wife has a t-shirt that says, "well-behaved women rarely make history." well, you know, i don't want to burst her bubble, but the same is true with men.

it is impossible to be a maverick or a true original if you're too well behaved and don't want to break the rules. you have to think outside the box. that's what i believe. after all, what is the point of being on this earth if all you want to do is be liked by everyone and avoid trouble?

the only way that i ever got anyplace was by breaking some of the rules. after all, i remember that after i was finished with my bodybuilding career i wanted to get into acting and i wanted to be a star in films. you can imagine what the agents said when i went to meet all those agents. everyone had the same line, that it can't be done, the rules are different here. they said, "look at your body. you have this huge monstrous body, overly developed. that doesn't fit into the movies. you don't understand.

this was 20 years ago, the hercules movies. now the little guys are in, dustin hoffman, woody allen, jack nicholson." before he gained weight, of course, that is. but anyway, those are the guys that were in. and the agents also complained about my accent. they said, "no one ever became a star with an accent like that, especially not with a german accent.

and yes, i can imagine with your name, arnold schwartzenschnitzel, or whatever the name, is, on a billboard. yeah, that's going to draw a lot of tickets and sell a lot of tickets. yeah, right." so this is the kind of negative attitude they had.

but i didn't listen to those rules, even though they were very nice and they said, "look, we can get you some bit parts. we can get you to be playing a wrestler or a bouncer. oh, maybe with your german accent we can get you to be a nazi officer in hogan's heroes or something like that."

but i didn't listen to all this. those were their rules, not my rules. i was convinced i could do it if i worked as hard as i did in bodybuilding, five hours a day. and i started getting to work, i started taking acting classes. i took english classes, took speech classes, dialogue classes. accent removal classes i even took.

i remember running around saying, "a fine wine grows on the vine." you see, because germans have difficulties with the f and the w and v, so, "a fine wine grows on the vine." i know what some of you are now saying, is i hope that arnold got his money back.

but let me tell you something, i had a good time doing those things and it really helped me. and finally i broke through. i broke through and i started getting the first parts in tv; streets of san francisco, lucille ball hired me, i made pumping iron, stay hungry. and then i got the big break in conan the barbarian. (applause)

and there the director said, "if we wouldn't have schwarzenegger, we would have to build one." now, think about that. and then, when i did terminator, "i'll be back," became one of the most famous lines in movie history, all because of my crazy accent.

now, think about it. the things that the agents said would be totally a detriment and would make it impossible for me to get a job, all of a sudden became an asset for me, all of those things, my accent, my body and everything.

so it just shows to you, never listen to that you can't do something. and, "you have to work your way up, of course, run for something else first." i mean, it was the same when i ran for governor, the same lines, that you have to work your way up, it can't be done. and then, of course, i ran for governor and the rest, of course, is history.

they said you have to start with a small job as mayor and then as assemblyman and then as lieutenant governor and then as governor. and they said that's the way it works in a political career. i said, "i'm not interested in a political career. i want to be a public servant. i want to fix california's problems and bring people together and bring the parties together.

so, like i said, i decided to run, i didn't pay attention to the rules. and i made it and the rest is history.

rule number three: do not be afraid to fail.

anything i've ever attempted, i was always willing to fail. in the movie business, i remember, that you pick scripts. many times you think this is a wining script, but then, of course, you find out later on, when you do the movie, that it didn't work and the movie goes in the toilet.

now, we have seen my movies; i mean, red sonja, hercules in new york, last action hero. those movies went in the toilet. but that's ok, because at the same time i made movies like terminator and conan and true lies and predator and twins that went through the roof.

so you can't always win, but don't afraid of making decisions.

you can't be paralyzed by fear of failure or you will never push yourself. you keep pushing because you believe in yourself and in your vision and you know that it is the right thing to do, and success will come. so don't be afraid to fail.

rule number four: do not listen to naysayers.

how many times have you heard that you can't do this and you can't do that and it's never been done before? just imagine if bill gates had quit when people said it can't be done.

i hear this all the time. as a matter of fact, i love it when someone says that no one has ever done this before, because then when i do it that means that i'm the first one that has done it. so pay no attention to the people that say it can't be done.

i remember my mother-in-law, eunice kennedy shriver, when she started special olympics in 1968 people said that it would not work. the experts, the doctors that specialized in mental disabilities and mental retardation said, "it can't be done. you can't bring people out of their institutions. you can't make them participate in sports, in jumping and swimming and in running. they will hurt themselves, they will hurt each other, they will drown in the pool."

well, let me tell you something. now, 40 years later, special olympics is one of the greatest organizations, in 164 countries, dedicated to people with mental disabilities and that are intellectually challenged. (applause)

and she did not take no for an answer. and the same is when you look at barack obama. i mean, imagine, if he would have listened. (applause) if he would have listened to the naysayers he would have never run for president. people said it could not be done, that he could not get elected, that he could not beat hillary clinton, that he would never win the general election.

but he followed his own heart, he did not listen to the naysayers, ad he changed the course of american history.

so over and over you see that. if i would have listened to the naysayers i would still be in the austrian alps yodeling. (laughter) i would never have come to america. i would have never met my wonderful wife maria shriver, i would have never had the wonderful four kids, i would have never done terminator, and i wouldn't be standing here in front of you today as governor of the greatest state of the greatest country in the world.

so i never listen that, "you can't." (applause) i always listen to myself and say, "yes, you can." 

and that brings me to rule number five, which is the most important rule of all: work your butt off. you never want to fail because you didn't work hard enough. i never wanted to lose a competition or lose an election because i didn't work hard enough. i always believed leaving no stone unturned.

mohammed ali, one of my great heroes, had a great line in the '70s when he was asked, "how many sit-ups do you do?" he said, "i don't count my sit-ups. i only start counting when it starts hurting. when i feel pain, that's when i start counting, because that's when it really counts."

that's what makes you a champion. arnold schwarzenegger in kindergarten copand that's the way it is with everything. no pain, no gain. so many of those lessons that i apply in life i have learned from sports, let me tell you, and especially that one. and let me tell you, it is important to have fun in life, of course.

but when you're out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same time is working hard.

someone is getting smarter and someone is winning. just remember that. now, if you want to coast through life, don't pay attention to any of those rules.

but if you want to win, there is absolutely no way around hard, hard work.

none of my rules, by the way, of success, will work unless you do. i've always figured out that there 24 hours a day. you sleep six hours and have 18 hours left. now, i know there are some of you out there that say well, wait a minute, i sleep eight hours or nine hours. well, then, just sleep faster, i would recommend. (laughter)

because you only need to sleep six hours and then you have 18 hours left, and there are a lot of things you can accomplish. as a matter of fact, ed turner used to say always, "early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and advertise."

and, of course, all of you know already those things, because otherwise you wouldn't be sitting here today. just remember, you can't climb the ladder of success with your hands in your pockets. 

 and that takes me to rule number six, which is a very important rule: it's about giving back. whatever path that you take in your lives, you must always find time to give something back, something back to your community, give something back to your state or to your country.

my father-in-law, sargent shriver -- who is a great american, a truly great american who started the peace corps, the job corps, legal aid to the poor -- he said at yale university to the students at a commencement speech, "tear down that mirror. tear down that mirror that makes you always look at yourself, and you will be able to look beyond that mirror and you will see the millions of people that need your help."

and let me tell you something, reaching out and helping people will bring you more satisfaction than anything else you have ever done. as a matter of fact today, after having worked for special olympics and having started after school programs, i've promoted fitness, and now with my job as governor, i can tell you, playing a game of chess with an eight-year-old kid in an inner city school is far more exciting for me than walking down another red carpet or a movie premiere.

so let me tell you, as you prepare to go off into the world, remember those six rules:

trust yourself, break some rules, don't be afraid to fail, ignore the naysayers, work like hell, and give something back.

and now let me leave you with one final thought, and i will be brief, i promise. this university was conceived in 1880, back when los angeles was just a small frontier town. one hundred and twenty-five classes of trojans have gone before you. they have sat there, exactly where you sit today, in good times and in bad, in times of war and in times of peace, in times of great promise and in times of great uncertainty.

through it all, this great country, this great state, this great university, have stood tall and persevered. we are in tough times now and there's a lot of uncertainty in the world. but there is one thing certain; we'll be back. (applause)

and we will back stronger and more prosperous than ever before, because that is what california and america have always done. the ancient trojans were known for their fighting spirit, their refusal to give up, their ability to overcome great odds.

so as you graduate today, never lose that optimism and that fighting spirit. never lose the spirit of troy. because remember, this is america and you are usc trojans, proud, strong and ready to soar. congratulations and god bless all of you. thank you very much. thank you. (applause)

so never give up and never be afraid of failure, because otherwise you box yourself in and you limit yourself. i was never afraid to fail when i ran for governor. i was never afraid to fail to tackle anything because you should not be afraid of failure, that is just part of life. i have lived for those principles and i have had a lot of fun doing it and i have made a lot of money at the same time.

of course, i have to tell you, no matter how successful you get, no matter how old you get, you always have to be hungry for more. you always have to be hungry for learning new things, because you never learn enough. i for instance learned, when i grew up i always thought that greatness was directly tied to fame and fortune. i thought that the big career and the money and the achievement would equal success, but i was dead wrong. i learned that later on.

i learned that totally by coincidence when the university of wisconsin did a research program on what effect weight-training would have for special olympians for intellectually challenged people. they called me. they said arnold, you are the expert in this subject; we want you to come up to the university and help us with our program, to help us with our special olympians. i flew up to the university of wisconsin, and i helped. there were these kids; the first exercise we decided to do was bench-press, and they were all standing in line. the first kid layed down on the bench; i put the 40 lb bobble over his chest and he did the simple exercise of bench-press. he did 10 reps. then he got up and the next one laid down; i put the bobble over his chest, and then that kid started breathing really heavy, and all of a sudden he started screaming really loud. he jumped up and put the bar back and he started shaking. i realized he was scared of the weight. so i calmed him down, i said that is okay, just watch your friends do the bench-press and maybe you want to try it again. the friends came through and they did all the bench-press and everyone did great performance, and then all of a sudden he stood in line at the end and tried again. he laid down; this time i gave him the empty bar, just the 20 lbs and he did 10 reps and then i said do you want to have more plates on it? more weight? he said yes. so i put two more plates on it. now he was back to the 40 lbs he had earlier and he did 10 more reps. then he said more. then i put two more plates on it. now it was 60 lbs and he did another 10 reps. he said more. he did 80 lbs.

then i lifted the weight off and he jumped up, high-fived everyone and he was so excited. it was a real eye-opener for me because when i saw that kid going from terror to self-confidence in that short period of time, and that i had that effect on him, that i could do that, i was so excited about it. as a matter of fact, i went home to the hotel that night and i was so delighted and i said to myself, what is going on here? wait a minute, i did not make any money. it was not a career move at all. it was nothing, why am i so excited? well let me tell you, i figured out that it was because i was reaching out and helping someone that needed help.

my father-in-law sergeant shriver, who started during the kennedy administration and johnson administration, the peace corps, the job corps, legal aid to the poor, head start, and all of those very important programs. he gave a speech at the yale university, and he said it very clearly when he said to the students, tear down that mirror. tear down that mirror that makes you always look at yourself. tear down that mirror and you will be able to look beyond and you will see the millions and millions of people that need your help. i realized then when he said that, that is what happened to me that day, that i tore down my mirror that made me always look at myself and always worry about how can i get rich, how can i get famous, how can i make money, how can i make a career move? i tore down that mirror and looked beyond and i saw all the special olympians that needed my help.

this was a great, great learning; this is why i say stay hungry to learn those new things. for years now i have been involved in special olympics. for years, i have been the national coach, the international coach, the torch-bearer, the ambassador for special olympians and traveling all around the world and helping them, pumping up those athletes, marching with them into stadiums, training with them, waiting at the finish line to hug them and congratulate them and put the medal over their head and hang it around them. this has been such a wonderful thing, and such a satisfying thing.

as a matter of fact, on one of those trips i went to south africa and there i got to meet my hero, one of my heroes, nelson mandela. talk about greatness. see, this is a different greatness than what i had ever thought was important. he spent 27 years in prison because he believed black south africans should be equal but when he was released from prison, instead of seeking revenge, he talked about forgiveness. mandela said the most important thing was reconciliation and bringing his country together. as a matter of fact, after he was released from prison he had lunch with the wife of the prime minister who was the architect of apartheid. think about that, having lunch with her, the man that was responsible for putting him into prison. mandela became a living message of love, inclusion and tolerance. now that is greatness.

helping others and looking beyond that mirror is my measure of greatness today. that is what makes me feel good about myself, and i can tell you today i would rather go to an after-school program and help a little girl and play chess with her than going down another red-carpet at a movie premiere.

i know that one of the reasons you invited me here today was to honor my commitment to public service. that is a great honor coming from a university that has distinguished itself through service. i know that you are not just famous all over the country and all over the world because of the great education that you provide here, but also because of the extraordinary service of reaching out into the community and to the state. as a matter of fact, one my favorite things that you do here is host the georgia special olympic games. what a great accomplishment. you have been doing this at this university for two decades. let us give the university a great-great hand for that great work.

now i want to thank you on behalf of my mother-in-law, eunice kennedy shriver, who started special olympics more than 40 years ago. we lost her this last year but i know that she is looking down from heaven right now and smiling, knowing that i am talking about special olympics and thanking you for the great work that you have done because she changed the world by starting the special olympics movement. she is a shining example of the chain reaction that begins simply by one person taking that simple step forward. of course she had the nay-sayers; it was not easy. when she said i want to take those special olympians, those people out of those institutions, all the experts said, this is the wrong thing to do. if they are doing sports they will hurt themselves, and they will hurt one another and they will drown in the swimming pool. she was not listening to the nay-sayers. she moved on, she campaigned and she called and pushed relentlessly for human and civil rights. she never took no for an answer. now because of that, special olympics is in 179 countries all over the world. millions and millions of kids are now participating in sports, and getting health care and dental care, and getting jobs.

as a matter of fact, i have a special olympian in my office, john is doing such a great job delivering the mail all over my office and always coming up with new ways of being more efficient. i wish the rest of the politicians in our state capital were as efficient as he is, trust me. this is extraordinary to see his work and i believe that we each have the same responsibility to use our voice to serve and to make a difference.

i take that responsibility really seriously. and that it is why i ran for governor of the great state of california, because i knew that i could reach out to 38 million people. that is why it gives me such a satisfaction today.believe me, when i was 15 years old i never thought that i would ever become governor of california. i am one of those fortunate ones that went way beyond his dreams. another thing that i never would have dreamt in my wildest dreams was that i would have worked for free for 7 years as governor, never, but i knew serving california would be an opportunity for me to make a difference, not only in my state, but to make a difference in this country, and to make a difference in the world.

as an immigrant it is very important to give back, more so than anyone. if you are born here it is important to give back but if you come here as an immigrant it is twice as important to give something back because this country received you with open arms. this is the land of opportunity. i know that i would not have accomplished even 10% of the things i have accomplished if i would not have come to the united states. this is without any doubt, the greatest country in the world. even though there are so many people complaining about america, i say to them shut up! this is the greatest country in the world.

this is why i wanted to give something back. so i became governor, and we started to make things change. we changed things to rebuild the california infrastructure, workers compensation, we reformed government to make government run more efficiently, and to fight global warming and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by the year 2020 to fight global warming and also not to rely on the oil that comes from countries that hate us. yes we are going to fight and continue doing that, and finally we also woke up the federal government to make sure that they have an environmental policy in place very soon and an energy policy.

those are the kinds of positive changes that i went after. all of this action happening, it was all happening because we worked very hard, we did not think about ourselves, but we thought about how can we help the state and the country. we went out global.

now of course when i talk about this, when i talk about how important it is for each and every one of you to go out and do this, i do not think that you should go global or that you should go this big, like i said i just happened to be very ambitious.

you all should go and be hungry for success. you should be hungry to make your mark, and you should be hungry to be seen and to be heard and to have an effect out there but as you move on and become successful make sure to also stay hungry for helping others and looking beyond that mirror. start with simple things, like coaching a school soccer team, or helping a child learn to read, or deliver meals to someone who is homebound. we in california now have 7 million volunteers. i was the first governor to appoint a cabinet secretary to be in charge of volunteerism and service. now other governors are doing the same thing around the country.

use your power and potential and make this nation, and this world, a better place. it worked for this immigrant who came over here to this country with $20 in his pocket. i know and i guarantee it will work for you, too, the 2010 graduates of emory university. i am proud of each and every one of you, of how far you have come and i know you are going to make great, great contributions to this state and to the world. so congratulations once again and god bless all of you. thank you very much, thank you.

between the years
when the oceans drank atlantis
and the rise of the sons of arius,
there was an age undreamed of,
when shining kingdoms
lay spread across the world.
hither came conan, the cimmerian,
sword in hand.
it is i, his chronicler,
who knows well his saga.
now, let me tell you of
the days of high adventure.
 i think we made the merchant angry.
 are you surprised?
 but we didn't steal everything he had.
 we didn't have time.
 why aren't they trying to kill us?
 maybe they want to capture us,
then torture us to death.
conan, help!
 do you know who i am?
 taramis.
 queen taramis.
 not my queen.
you have a queen?
but you are a cimmerian.
the cimmerians have no rulers.
you're a barbarian.
you live free in the world.
you owe allegiance to no one.
is that not so?
it is and it always will be.
 what do you want?
 i need your help.
 no.
 no?
you don't know what i'd give you
if you help me.
you have nothing that i want.
you were praying, conan.
what were you praying for?
look at the shrine.
see what you were praying for
what is there, conan?
think.
show me the desire in your deepest heart.
 valeria!
 where is this valeria?
 with crom.
 your god.
she sits by the side of my god.
what i want, you cannot give me.
 yes, i can.
 you can bring back the dead?
do as i ask of you and i will.
wake.
 and remember
 tell me what i must do.
soon.
conan! look!
doesn't that animal look familiar?
i think it does. i'm sorry about
what happened the last time.
they love us!
we will drink to dagoth,
the dreaming god.
 what do you want me to do for you?
 to bring back the woman you love?
yes.
it is written in the scrolls of skelos
that a woman child born with a certain
mark must make a perilous journey.
it is her destiny.
my niece jehnna has such a mark.
 i want you to take her on that journey.
 to where?
jehnna will show you.
from the day she was born,
she's been prepared for this.
there is a key she must find,
a key only she can touch,
as it was written in the scrolls of skelos.
 where is it?
in a castle.
 guarded?
 by a wizard called tothamon.
 by a wizard?
 that frightens you.
you're afraid of magic.
and you will have to deal with it.
what good is a sword against sorcery?
 then you're afraid to go?
 no. i will find a way.
 what does this key unlock?
 a treasure.
a jewelled horn. only she can procure it.
only she can lead you to it.
and when she has it,
you'll bring her back to me.
then you will have your reward.
we shall both have everything we want...
through magic.
no!
it's all right. don't be afraid.
 it's only a dream. it's only a dream.
 no, i saw...
a dream. only a dream.
 be still. lie down.
i saw it.
i saw it again.
 no, you saw nothing.
a nightmare.
lmaginings out of excitement.
go back to sleep.
i saw it...
i saw it.
i did. i saw it.
tomorrow you start your journey.
you'll need all your strength.
your destiny is at hand.
sleep.
sleep.
all our destinies are at hand,
even conan's,
 though he doesn't yet know it.
 we don't need him, my queen.
i don't need the captain of the guard
to steal a key. that is a task for a thief.
what i need you for is to see that this dear
child is returned safely to the palace
with both the treasure
and her virginity intact.
i will protect them both.
you'd better, my friend, for she must be
a virgin when she's returned to me,
so she can be properly sacrificed.
one other thing, bombaata.
it is not wise to have the king of thieves
near the treasure.
so when the key is in my niece's hand,
i want your sword in conan's heart.
have the elite guard follow. they will
strike at the right moment to help you.
conan must die.
do you think he's handsome?
very ugly.
no, not him. conan.
can't you judge for yourself?
but how can i?
how many times have i seen a man?
a real man.
all i've seen is you.
meaning no insult to you, bombaata.
yes. he is handsome.
conan, wait! we must go this way.
 not yet.
 but you have to obey me.
weren't you told?
there are rules to every game.
i believe you.
but there's magic in this game
and i have to be able
to fight it with magic.
akiro!
crom!
 what are they going to do?
 have lunch.
those savages should thank me,
sparing them a terrible stomachache.
why would they wanna eat someone
as old and as sour as you?
they thought if they digested me,
my magic would be in their blood.
at least they coulda washed you first.
i need you.
 i'm yours.
tell me more about this key.
oh, it's not an ordinary key. it's a jewel.
 a jewel?
 yes. the heart of ahriman.
 well, can it be worn?
 only by me.
no one else dare touch it.
lf there is anything here that you like,
try not to take it.
i know when to steal and when not to.
hit her get her!
 what did she do?
 she came with bandits to raid us.
the others are dead. now it's her turn,
after we have our fun with her
don't kill her too soon!
 save her!
 thieves should be hanged.
conan, there are six of them against her
one, two, three... i think you're right.
and she's tied to the stake.
do something!
stop.
i think we made a friend.
 wait here.
what do you want?
 to come with you.
 be off!
 let me speak to conan.
i said be off.
stop!
leave.
i swear that if conan will let me ride
with him, i will give my life for him.
we shall see.
the castle of tothamon. it holds the key.
come bring her, conan.
 we leave now.
in the morning.
 i'm the leader here.
 lead in the morning.
it will be better we must rest.
my thinking exactly.
sleep.
in the morning you will touch
the heart of ahriman.
the first to do so in a thousand years.
look!
jehnna... jehnna!
jehnna!
akiro, where is she?
in there!
 who took her?
 a giant bird.
a bird of smoke.
into the boat!
somebody should stay
and watch the horses.
malak!
i didn't mean me.
i'm rowing!
too late, my friends.
but come... come anyway.
how do we get in?
is there another entrance?
under here is a way in.
 you mean under the water?
 you can stay here if you like.
alone?
they need me.
bombaata.
wizard it open.
fine magician you are.
go back to juggling apples.
get up! get him!
that's exactly what i would have done.
exactly.
there are only two left, wizard,
and you're behind one of them.
which one?
 no! not here!
 it's us!
bombaata.
bombaata!
bombaata!
bombaata!
i need you!
bombaata!
 bombaata...
 it's all right.
crom!
out! out of here quick!
 hurry, hurry!
 quick! out!
bombaata!
all an illusion.
help! bombaata, help me!
bombaata, where are you?
i'm out taking care of some business at the moment!
put me down, do you hear me?
put me down!
look out, you fool!
bombaata, stop!
 why?
i thought you were going to hurt the girl.
this is one of the queen's guards.
 why did they attack us?
 not by her order
wait, wait. this is much better
akiro's own magic mixture.
let me help you.
 what do you think you're doing?
 covering your wound.
my wound is lower
we don't want an infection to spread.
i'll spread your head open.
is this what the world has come to?
you try to help somebody
and what do you get instead of thanks?
threats.
now, yell if it hurts.
i suppose nothing hurts you.
only pain.
after we return to shadizar,
what will you do?
i'll find my kingdom
and a queen to sit beside me.
what kingdom?
the promise i was kingdomed.
no...
the kingdom i was promised.
 what queen?
 valeria.
 valeria...
 valeria.
what is she like, this... valeria?
do you see this woman over there?
 zula?
 valeria is like her
she doesn't look like her,
but she has the same... spirit.
the same... the same...
strength?
strength. strength.
and she's a warrior too?
a great warrior
a great woman.
could there ever be...
anyone else but her?
another queen?
lot on your knife.
not on your life.
excuse me. i must get up now.
how do you feel?
welcome.
you are welcome.
i didn't know women could be warriors.
all my tribe are warriors.
well, it seems that
men like women warriors.
some.
do you think that i could ever be one?
i could teach you how to use this.
yes. please.
now, the power is in the wrists.
oh, i see. like this?
that's right. they've got to stay loose.
it takes practice and strength.
wait!
wait! wait, wait, wait, wait!
hold on.
lf you're going to learn how to fight,
then learn with a real weapon.
not with a toothpick.
here. i'll show you. stand like this.
yes. you do it. try it.
and then swing it over your head.
i'll help you. swing over your head.
good.
now you're ready to take on anybody.
how do you attract a man?
what i mean is...
suppose you set your heart on somebody,
what would you do to get him?
grab him! and take him!
you'd grab him and and take him?
take him, like that!
 what did she mean?
 what did she say?
well, she said that if she wanted a man,
she'd reach out and take him.
good idea.
but then what? i mean, you've got him.
what do you do with him?
that's easy. you see, you just...
you...
you see, in order for a man
to really know a woman
and for her to know him, they have to...
they have to... to join.
join?
get together
you see, he has to take his... his...
and grab her by the...
there you are, joined.
i mean, how do you think flowers grow?
 through this?
 yes.
is this the only way?
 yes.
 we can't go around it?
i go where i feel myself led.
so i've noticed.
that way.
shouldn't one of us
go back and stand guard?
bombaata.
together
here, let me help.
malak, go inside and see if there's a lock.
 you mean in there?
 go!
i found something. let go. easy.
it is written in the scrolls of skelos
that the horn will be
found by a woman child.
a virgin, who will have a mark upon her
and when the horn is placed once more
in the forehead of the dreaming god,
dagoth will arise.
then let men fear
death to the world.
the woman child will be sacrificed.
 stop her!
 be silent!
crom!
death to the world.
life for valeria.
the girl's destiny isn't only
to deliver the horn.
it's just writing on a wall.
she is to be killed. sacrificed.
we shall see, destiny or not.
everybody out!
out!
wait! it's worth a fortune!
 we come in peace.
 then let us go in peace.
let the girl come forward.
we've been waiting for her all our lives.
we are the keepers of the horn.
it belongs to us.
no longer
 who are you?
 conan.
i have heard of you.
do you know the legend
written on the wall of the crypt?
from the day of my birth.
then you know what will happen
if the horn is placed back
in the forehead of dagoth.
the god will live again.
and we who give him life will stand by his
right hand and rule the world with him.
you will die in the great evil
that will come from his rebirth!
 we will control him.
 no one is able to control him!
his power and his evil are too great!
give us the girl or we'll take her!
enough talk!
back to the crypt!
bombaata, get out!
out! let's get out of here!
behind the dragon there's a tunnel.
it could be our only way out.
the jewel. take the jewel.
hurry, hurry.
that way.
malak! malak, come on!
malak!
it's the leader he's a wizard.
 he's forcing the mouth open.
 well, stop him. kill him or something.
 my dagger is gone. you kill him.
 not me. it's bad luck to kill a wizard.
wait. there is a better way
to take care of a wizard.
well done, akiro.
lnto the tunnel.
don't stop. hurry! hurry!
run! run!
 where are the others?
 they're coming. don't worry. go!
 they've gone.
 taken their horses.
or been captured. let's flee.
wait.
bombaata took her
taramis planned it from the beginning.
we get the horn, her guards will kill us,
and bombaata takes the girl
and the horn back to her
 and her promise to you?
 a lie.
 where are we going?
 to shadizar
 what for?
 to stop jehnna's sacrifice.
but it's her destiny. it can't be stopped.
 you don't have to come.
i will.
i will.
i won't!
i mean, what's in it for us?
what are we? some charitable
institution? we're thieves!
go! i won't help!
hey!
hey, wait for me!
you know you can't do without me!
wait, conan, wait!
do you have the treasure?
bring it to me.
reserves to guard the palace.
there must be hundreds of them
around it. we can't get in there.
well, you can't say we didn't try.
 the front gate can't be the only way in.
 oh, it isn't...
malak?
at the bottom, behind the waterfall,
there's an entrance.
it used to be an exit. my cousin's sister's
brother dug his way out there,
when he was a prisoner in shadizar
today is your birthday.
all of shadizar is celebrating.
drink.
to life. to dagoth.
to dagoth.
oh, dagoth, god of gods.
my cousin's sister's brother
never said anything about bars.
how do we get back up?
the bars were put up after
your sister's brother's cousin escaped!
cousin's sister's brother how many
times do i have to tell you that?
 you said your sister's brother's cousin!
 who cares who it is?
what difference does it make?
at the first sign of life in our god,
the girl must be sacrificed.
or, as the scrolls of skelos say,
a catastrophe will befall us.
oh, dagoth, god of gods.
power above all power
kill her!
save the girl!
kill her! kill her! she must be sacrificed.
no!
get back!
down the steps!
no!
run!
his horn is his life! tear out the horn!
zula.
i need a captain of the guards.
i see no reason why a woman
wouldn't do as well as a man.
 you.
 me?
come here.
i understand that every king or queen
must have a fool.
 do i qualify?
 more than qualify.
will the world's greatest
wizard come forward, please?
at your service.
one cannot rule without wisdom.
 let me instruct you in the fine art of swordplay.
 later
rule shadizar with me.
i will have my own kingdom,
my own queen.
so it was that conan
mourned his lost valeria.
at length, he sought adventure
in distant lands
and trod the jewelled thrones of
the earth beneath his sandalled feet,
until at last he found his own kingdom
and wore his crown
upon a troubled brow.


come back onto this leg. weight on this leg.



 

                   

pull your weight back onto this....

off that leg.



 

                   

onto this leg. weight back, there you go.



 

                   

okay, just take with your arm.



 

                   

you wanna slide forward...



 

                   

and reach with your arm.



 

                   

and slide back, step back.



 

                   

  arnold, do it behind me.

  reach back with your arm.



 

                   

and forward.



  

                   

i'll do this twice, and then i'll come

and look at you and correct you.



  

                   

and back. now what you want is mobility.



  

                   

so you want a pass  through position

that will keep showing the body, right?



  

                   

  so where are your arms?

  like this.



  

                   

start, i would think, with the focus up.



  

                   

  looking up?

  looking up.



  

                   

that would help.... that'll make a nice....



  

                   

if your eye line goes up there....



  

                   

  right.

  yeah.



  

                   

that's the idea.



  

                   

what you have to realize....

okay, take it a little bit slower



  

                   

what you have to realize

is that people are watching you all the time.



  

                   

they're not just watching

you there and there.



  

                   

keep it up.



  

                   

and....



  

                   

gold's gym, venice, california...



  

                   

where many of the best bodybuilders

in the world come to train.



  

                   

jesus christ!



  

                   

  that's a sick guy.

  you're back.



  

                   

  how are you doing?

  all right.



  

                   

  big mac.

  how are you?



  

                   

  alright.

  good.



  

                   

  how you doing?

  you remember joey?



  

                   

how you doing?



  

                   

  paul.

  i thought you'd forgotten all about me.



  

                   

i thought you liked me as well.

thought you'd forgotten all about me.



  

                   

  i'm sorry.

  no, you're the greatest.



  

                   

big tony, how you doing?



  

                   

  this is for me?

  yeah.



  

                   

  kenny.

  how you been? just got back?



  

                   

can i sign up here?

l want to start gaining some muscles.



  

                   

come on.



  

                   

pumped up, you know.



  

                   

arnold schwarzenegger, 27yearsold...




                   

mr olympia for the past five years.



  

                   

he is preparing to defend his title

this year for the last time.



  

                   

all mr universes

from the past five years or so...



  

                   

get together in one contest to find out

who is the best of all the mr universes.



  

                   

so they created the mr olympia contest,

which is then the top contest.



  

                   

and whoever wins that

is the top bodybuilder



  

                   

  and you are the top bodybuilder

  right.



  

                   

how long have you been the top?



  

                   

i've not been beaten for the last seven years.



  

                   

and...



  

                   

l won the mr olympia contest

five years now.



  

                   

this is now the sixth year



  

                   

  they score on points?

  yeah, on points.



  

                   
it's like judging the body

by muscularity, and by proportion...



  

                   

symmetry, the whole thing.



  

                   

do you visualize yourself

as a piece of sculpture?



  

                   

yeah, definitely.



  

                   

good bodybuilders have the same mind...



  

                   

when it comes to sculpting,

than a sculptor has.



  

                   

if you analyze it,

you look in the mirror and you say:



  

                   

i need more deltoids, more shoulders,

so you get the proportions right.



  

                   

so what you do is you exercise...



  

                   

and put those deltoids on.



  

                   

whereas an artist

would just slap on some clay on each side.



  

                   

does it, maybe, the easier way.

we go through a harder way...



  

                   

because you have to do it on a human body.



  

                   

l mean, obviously a lot

of people look at you...



  

                   

and they think it's kind of strange,

what you're doing.



  

                   

but those are the people

who don't know much about it.



  

                   

as soon as you find out

what the whole thing is about...



  

                   

then it's just like another thing.



  

                   

it's not any stranger as going into a car..



  

                   

and trying to go in a quarter mile,

five seconds.



  

                   

l mean, that's, for me, strange.



  

                   

the greatest feeling you can get in a gym...



  

                   

or the most satisfying feeling

you can get in a gym, is the pump.



  

                   

let's say you train your biceps.



  

                   

blood is rushing into your muscles,

and that's what we call the pump.



  

                   

your muscles get a really tight feeling...



  

                   

like your skin is going to explode

any minute.



  

                   

it's really tight, it's like somebody

blowing air into your muscle.



  

                   

it just blows up and it feels different.

it feels fantastic.



  

                   

it's as satisfying to me as cumming is.



  

                   

as having sex with a woman and cumming.



  

                   

so can you believe

how much i'm in heaven?



  

                   

i'm getting the feeling of cumming in the gym.

i'm getting the feeling of cumming at home.



  

                   

i'm getting the feeling of cumming backstage

when i pump up...



  

                   

when i pose out in front of thousands people,

i get the same feeling.



  

                   

i'm cumming day and night.

i mean it's terrific, right?



  

                   

so, you know, i'm in heaven.



  

                   

all right, got to do that.



  

                   

this girl maybe didn't have a kiss for years.

i may as well give her a break.



  

                   

terminal island, california...



  

                   

a federal prison for men and women.



  

                   

i wanna get me a kiss.



   

                   

i heard about those guys in here.



   

                   

yeah, we got a few of them.



   

                   

come over here and i'll give you your kiss.



   

                   

yes, i got this pose.



   

                   

he's got a beautiful body, man.



   

                   

first time i ever seen

somebody's arms thirty inches.



   

                   

he's a big dude, all the way big dude.



   

                   

i started reading about gaining weight

and weightlifting in some magazines.



   

                   

and i saw arnold's picture.



   

                   

and when i saw him from all those angles...



   

                   

every angle those shots were taken from,

he looked good.



   

                   

and i said, that's the way i wanna look.



   

                   

my father's real tall and i'm short,

so at least...



   

                   

if i can't get as tall as he is,

i wanna be as wide as he was.



   

                   

if i can't get as tall as he is,

i wanna be as wide as he was.



   

                   

make one line. try to make one line straight.



   

                   

so you always remember

that you have to have a line.



   

                   

yeah, see now there's your line.



   

                   

and look where you point.



   

                   

yeah.



   

                   

great.



   

                   

i like what you had in ironman.



   

                   

yeah, that's good.



   

                   

again, raise up the hand.



   

                   

remember one thing, when you pose...



   

                   

a lot of little guys have one habit.



   

                   

and they hide away when they pose.



   

                   

when they do an arm pose, they do like this.



   

                   

the big guy will come right out

with his arm.



   

                   

never do that, never hide away.

like right now, you did like this.



   

                   

you know, show them.

show them the whole thing.



   

                   

make the move, open up the whole body.



   

                   

do the same thing again.



   

                   

yeah, great.



   

                   

look confident, yeah.



   

                   

good.



   

                   

yeah, do it!



   

                   

just pose slowly, good.



   

                   

they'll go nuts.



   

                   

crowd's good tonight. is it?



   

                   

close that arm more. good.



   

                   

mike katz.
                   

one of the top amateur bodybuilders

in the world.



   

                   

mike lives in north branford, connecticut,

and is a junior high school teacher



   

                   

show them the back,

turn around for the back.



   

                   

good girl.

michael, show her the most muscular

good girl.

  can you do that?

  i can do that one, dad.



   

                   

all right, you do that one.

she wants you to feel yours,

feel yours.



   

                   

  nothing, no muscle.

  nothing? how about daddy's?



   

                   

  daddy got a big muscle?

  yeah.



   

                   

come on, mike, ripped,

come on get up, come on.



   

                   

come on.



   

                   

good.



   

                   

get up.



   

                   

up.



   

                   

come on, up.



   

                   

i can remember back in my life...



   

                   

when i would be picked on quite often.

i'm sure every kid's gone through it.



   

                   

but it just affected me more than,

i think, it would affect other people.



   

                   

hey, four eyes, hey, cross  eyes. 



   

                   

you got rusty fenders on your bicycle.



   

                   

your bike isn't as good as our bike.



   

                   

hey, jew boy.



   

                   

or, you're not catholic,

so you're no good.



   

                   

i can remember times

when kids would be going to dances...



   

                   

and i would leave a dance,



   

                   

i'd leave a dance for no reason

and say, i'll show them.



   

                   

and go and run on a track

for two or three hours.



   

                   

or go home and lift weights.



   

                   

i got involved in all the peewee sports

most kids play, hockey and so forth.



   

                   

then when i got into high school...



   

                   

and i made all  state

and all  american in football.



   

                   

i was doing very well with the jets

until i got injured.



   

                   

that was my biggest thing, to go

on a football field and be so feared.



   

                   

i wanted to be put in a cage

and rolled out, like in a circus.



   

                   

big bars with chains and everything.

and then just hope like hell...



   

                   

that everybody would run off the field

when they saw me coming.



   

                   

let's give him a big welcome, mike katz.



   

                   

in every contest i ever won...



   

                   

or ever lost, i always got

the most applause...



   

                   

and the people were most for me.



   

                   
                   

i knew, even though

i didn't win the contest...



   

                   

when i go to south africa this year,

i'm sure the same thing is gonna happen.



   

                   

the crowd is gonna be for me.



   

                   

the contests in south africa, in pretoria...



   

                   

are the most important or prestigious

amateur contests in the world...



   

                   

the ifbb mr universe contest...



   

                   

which is amateur, open to amateur athletes.



   

                   

sort of along the guidelines

of the olympics.



   

                   

and the other contest

is a professional contest...



   

                   

open to professionals,

because there's money prizes involved...



   

                   

and that's called the mr olympia.



   

                   

so i'll be competing in the mr universe,

since i am an amateur



   

                   

and...



   

                   

as i see it, from all of the people

who i know who are gonna be there...



   

                   

and the best in the world will be there...



   

                   

i feel it's gonna be between

me and ken waller..



   

                   

for the overall championship.



   

                   

i told you boys, i'm the quarterback.



   

                   

i don't worry about mike katz, anyway.

the only one guy i worry about is robbie.



   

                   

he's good, but he lacks too many things.



   

                   

his arms aren't big enough

to match his chest.



   

                   

his thighs are too big for his calves.



   

                   

he hits one pose.



   

                   

in that, he looks like a big spider



   

                   

what i'm gonna do when i get to africa?

i'm gonna take katz's shirt and hide it.



   

                   

i'm gonna take everything i can find

of his and hide it.



   

                   

mess his mind up a little bit.



   

                   

gonna be according to countries

in alphabetical order



   

                   

australia.



   

                   

we need australia.

will you get your clan together, please?



   

                   

baghdad, bahamas.



   

                   

tall man calls mike katz, usa.



   

                   

i don't think there's much doubt.

mike? all right.



   

                   

ken waller, usa.



   

                   

you didn't see a blue t-shirt around?



   

                   

paul, you see a blue t-shirt

around with my crusher?



   

                   

  waller had it.

  he had it?



   

                   

  yeah.

  where did he put it?



   

                   

l don't know where he put it, mike.



   

                   

number   

from the united states of america...



   

                   

mike katz.



   

                   

it took me five years to win mr connecticut.



   

                   

it took me four years to win mr america.



   

                   

this is my fifth year

that i've been trying to win mr universe.



   

                   

i'm not a quitter



   

                   

it's like a dog. you can kick a dog so long

and it will do two things.



   

                   

it's either gonna roll over and die...



   

                   

or it's gonna bite you and attack you.



   

                   

and i'm the kind of person who's

the type of a dog who would bite back.



   

                   

i wasn't gonna roll over and quit.



   

                   

                .



   

                   

  .



   

                   

next one,               .



   

                   

    .

    ? that can't be right.



   

                   

it's a nine, yes.



   

                   

               .



   

                   

that's a four



   

                   

yes,             .



   

                   

  total.

i can imagine how he must feel.



   

                   

incredible.



   

                   

probably like i did when i was   

and won my first trophy.



   

                   

in its own way,

it's probably just as satisfying.



   

                   

i gotta go shake his hand,

that's fantastic, great.

my parents in the beginning,

when i started bodybuilding...



   

                   

they didn't know really what it is...



   

                   

until i introduced my father

to bodybuilding...



   

                   

and i took him to all the gymnasiums.



   

                   

and he then started picking up weights,

and making his arms strong and so on.



   

                   

and then they started liking what i did.



   

                   

especially after i won

the first international competition...



   

                   

which was the first contest i ever entered...



   

                   

the junior mr europe in stuttgart, germany.



   

                   

so when i came home with my trophy,

my parents were very proud of me...



   

                   

and they said, my son, that's my son. 



   

                   

my father was a police chief in austria...



   

                   

in a town called graz.



   

                   

we had a very strict upbringing

because of him being with the police force.



   

                   

we had to be the perfect example.



   

                   

we couldn't do anything bad.



   

                   

and it was kind of an uptight

feeling at home because of it.



   

                   

i always felt like my place is america.

and when i was ten years old...



   

                   

i only dreamed of coming

to america and being the greatest.



   

                   

and just being different

than everybody else.



   

                   

i never experienced anything like it.



   

                   

  open your legs wide, arnold.

  open my    



   

                   

get a little more power



   

                   

  open your legs a little more.

  little bit to the right.



   

                   

don't strain looking up at him.



   

                   

just put your face, just hug him,

kind of sexy.



   

                   

crush it, arnold.



   

                   

bend the exerciser



   

                   

i thought you were strong.



   

                   

put your legs behind his back a bit,

could you?



   

                   

play with his hair a little.



   

                   

sandy, why don't you get down lower..



   

                   

so that your head is down

closer to the floor



   

                   

that's it, right.



   

                   

okay, here we go.



   

                   

good, hold.



   

                   

  you drink skim milk, don't you?

  no, i drink no milk.



   

                   

  you don't drink any milk at all?

  no milk.



   

                   

milk is for babies.



   

                   

when you grow up, you have to drink beer



   

                   

i was always dreaming about

very powerful people.



   

                   

dictators and things like that.



   

                   

i was just always impressed

by people who could...



   

                   

be remembered for hundreds of years.



   

                   

even like jesus,

being for thousands of years remembered.



   

                   

  i dreamt about arnold last night.

  really?



   

                   

i told him, arnold, you're making

a big mistake going to africa.



   

                   

he says,

why do you say that, mr ferrigno?



   

                   

i said, louie is waiting for you,

in the shadows.



   

                   

lou ferrigno, 21-years-old,

a former sheet metal worker



   

                   

mr america, and twice mr universe.



   

                   

he's turned professional this year,

and is a contender for the mr olympia title.



   

                   

lou lives with his parents

in brooklyn, new york.




                   

lou is the largest bodybuilder ever



   

                   

and he thinks he can take the title

from arnold this year



   

                   

so does his father, matty...



   

                   

who retired from the new york city police

department to oversee lou's training.



   

                   

the first time arnold came to america,

i took louie backstage.



   

                   

and when arnold went by us,

i'll never forget...



   

                   

i looked at louie's face,

and he just looked at arnold with awe.



   

                   

i thought god just passed us.



   

                   

and i looked at louie, i said,

what do you think, louie?



   

                   

and he looked at me,

he said, gee, dad, he's big. 



   

                   

and i would say that from that moment on

when he first saw arnold...



   

                   

he wanted to be mr olympia.



   

                   

it was in his eye, in his heart,

and in his mind.



   

                   

and it became part of his entire body.



   

                   

okay.



   

                   

  right, let me complete a full rep.

  okay.



   

                   

  one.

  right.



   

                   

  two.

  right.



   

                   

up!



   

                   

five.



   

                   

six.



   

                   

seven.



   

                   

eight.



   

                   

nine.



   

                   

  okay, dad.

  okay, come on.



   

                   

up, come on.



   

                   

make it harder all right.



   

                   

come on.



   

                   

all the way.



   

                   

all right.



   

                   

  that was easy.

  easy?



   

                   

you do one.



   

                   

louie was only an infant in the crib,

and he developed this ear infection.



   

                   

we didn't know it at the time...



   

                   

until louie was about three years old,

we found out that he was hard of hearing.



   

                   

that's why he never took

an interest in things...



   

                   

other kids would take an interest in,

like television.



   

                   

he was late

learning to speak and everything.



   

                   

louie would become a lip reader



   

                   

louie was a real skinny kid.



   

                   

he couldn't make the football team

because he was too skinny.



   

                   

then he started to buy muscle magazine.



   

                   

i remember i would take him

to a bookstore...



   

                   

and he would buy up all

the old muscle books.



   

                   

and he would read for hours. i remember..



   

                   

 .:    .:   in the morning,

i would find his light on...



   

                   

and he would be reading the muscle books.



   

                   

so louie decided

to do a little bodybuilding.



   

                   

i had an old weightlifting set in the cellar

i used to do a little bit of it myself.



   

                   

never knowing at that time that someday...



   

                   

louie would be on the stage against arnold,

in pretoria, south africa.



   

                   

you just keep after him.



   

                   

wherever he goes,

you pose down with him, right next to him.



   

                   

let the judges make a comparison.

you're  ' .



   

                   

you'll be the biggest thing that ever went

out on that platform, at fifty pounds.



   

                   

they know that, and he knows it.

this is for the big baby, louie.



   

                   

this is for all the marbles.

and we're gonna go after it, right?



   

                   

one year of training, all wrapped up

in one night, louie, remember that.



   

                   

when you step out there, boy...



   

                   

remember all those grueling nights

and mornings in the gym.



   

                   

and this is it, this is the reward.

and we want it.



   

                   

we want it so bad that we can taste it.



   

                   

remember that when we're on that stage.



   

                   

we gotta get so excited, when we're there

we have only one thought in mind.



   

                   

that's the olympia, we'll win.



   

                   

  how long is arnold sleeping?

  he's been here for a couple days now.



   

                   

yeah, a couple days?



   

                   

the reason why i woke you up

was because...



   

                   

i am gonna go to new york tonight.

i did wanna say goodbye.



   

                   

and i'm gonna see ferrigno there.



   

                   

we're gonna train for two, three weeks.

and everything...



   

                   

that i learned from you...



   

                   

that you stole from me, i'm gonna give him.



   

                   

i figure the combination's gonna be

very hard to beat, arnold, very hard.



   

                   

i'll see you when you get back.



   

                   

what should i tell louie

when i get to new york?



   

                   

i mean, i am gonna train with him

for a few days.



   

                   

tell louie...



   

                   

  that i said hi.

  yeah?



   

                   

say to his father that i said hi.



   

                   

and i'm looking forward

to seeing him in south africa.



   

                   

  okay?

  all right.



   

                   

ln other words, you want me to be very nice.



   

                   

  be very nice to him.

  okay.



   

                   

because he needs a lot of help.



   

                   

  see, the king of the hill can only go down.

  that's right.



   

                   

  the king of the hill can only go down.

  or stay up.



   

                   

  or stay on that hill.

  right.



   

                   

that's the other possibility.



   

                   

but the wolf on the hill    



   

                   

the wolf on the hill, right...



   

                   

is not as hungry

as the wolf climbing the hill.



   

                   

that's true, he's not as hungry.

but when he wants the food, it's there.



   

                   

biceps, the back, trapezius another thing.



   

                   

also, in fact, this evening i'm gonna jog

about a mile and a half, two miles.



   

                   

i think that's a good idea.



   

                   

  you think we need more weight, hank?

  couple more pounds.



   

                   

all right, good.



   

                   

here, we got    right here.



   

                   

come on, let's do ten good reps, lou.

  i'm not satisfied. i'll put more weight.

  let's go.



   

                   

i wanna beat him!

  how do you feel, lou?

  pretty good.



   

                   

don't ever feel sorry for yourself.



   

                   

remember, if you're training hard,

he may be training twice as hard.



   

                   

you just gotta keep coming back stronger



   

                   

right.



   

                   

all the way, louie,

you'll never get this chance again.



   

                   

all the way.



   

                   

look like a road map back here

with fingers all over it.



   

                   

yeah?

come on.



   

                   

let's get serious.



   

                   

two more.



   

                   

two more, no matter what.



   

                   

one more, eddie. flex when you come up.



   

                   

goddamn.



   

                   

that's good.



   

                   

the body that isn't used to

maybe the ninth, tenth...



   

                   

eleventh, and twelfth rep

with a certain weight.



   

                   

so that makes the body grow, then.

going through this pain barrier



   

                   

experiencing pain

in your muscles and aching...



   

                   

and just go on and go on.



   

                   

and this last

two or three or four repetitions...



   

                   

that's what makes the muscle then grow.



   

                   

and that divides one from a champion

and one from not being a champion.



   

                   

if you can go through this pain barrier,

you may get to be a champion.



   

                   

if you can't go through, forget it.



   

                   

and that's what most people lack,

is having the guts.



   

                   

the guts to go in and just say, i'll go

through and i don't care what happens.



   

                   

it aches, and if i fall down....

i have no fear of fainting in a gym...



   

                   

because i know it could happen.



   

                   

i threw up many times

while i was working out.



   

                   

but it doesn't matter,

because it's all worth it.



   

                   

franco colombu.



   

                   

the premier bodybuilder

in the world under 200 pounds.



   

                   

five times a contender

for the mr olympia title...



   

                   

he plans to win it this year from arnold.



   

                   

once the featherweight

boxing champion of italy...



   

                   

franco comes from

a small village in sardinia.



   

                   

here, when you want to say,

where are you going?



   

                   

somebody says, go to hell

when they get upset.



   

                   

there they say, go to california.



   

                   

it's like a place where you never get there.



   

                   

and then finally i came to california, really.



   

                   

and now when i go back there

and they ask me, where you live?



   

                   

i say, in california.



   

                   

they're not sure if i mean it or if i'm joking.



   

                   

when i first started doing sports...



   

                   

my mother used to scream at me.



   

                   

she used to say, you don't want to work.



   

                   

you're just trying to punch people...



   

                   

trying to make a living without working. 

and she was very much against that.



   

                   

but right now,

after everything went so good...



   

                   

and i won in sports and i made money...



   

                   

they are very proud about that.



   

                   

i'm the strongest bodybuilder

that ever lived, i think.



   

                   

ladies and gentlemen...



   

                   

the strongest man in the world

is blowing up a hot  water bottle.



   

                   

that takes ten pounds of pressure.



   

                   

it's gonna pop.



   

                   

  okay, franco.

  lazy bastards.



   

                   

look.



   

                   

i missed it.



   

                   

okay.



   

                   

i met arnold in germany.



   

                   

he came to united states,

i came to united states, also.



   

                   

we went through many things together



   

                   

and now, i will be competing

in the mr olympia with arnold.



   

                   

of course, i think i'm gonna win.



   

                   

i have more definition...



   

                   

and i'm more muscular



   

                   

but arnold's taller than me,

and that can be one advantage for him.



   

                   

i think i can show the best out there.



   

                   

the only problem now is matter

of the judges' opinion, too.



   

                   

you never really know

what's going to happen.



   

                   

okay, louie.



   

                   

no, listen.



   

                   

when you come out here

and you're out here....



   

                   

right? they're all waiting for you, louie.



   

                   

they wanna see what you got,

they've never seen you before.



   

                   

you tense your legs, right?



   

                   

then you look at the crowd.



   

                   

they're all looking at you.

flashbulbs going off and all.



   

                   

then you put your arms like this.



   

                   

you look at your arms

like you're admiring, right?



   

                   

you're admiring what you're gonna

show them. and then you go....



   

                   

boom! like you're saying:



   

                   

take a look at this hunk of man.



   

                   

something like that. you try it now.



   

                   

look up, that's right.



   

                   

that's it. no, down here, louie.



   

                   

i told you, look at your arms down here.



   

                   

look at both arms.



   

                   

  both arms?

  right.



   

                   

that's it.



   

                   

atta boy.



   

                   

now hold that pose.



   

                   

because remember,

your arms are bigger than arnold's.



   

                   

they wanna see them, right?



   

                   

they have never seen your arms.

they've seen arnold's.



   

                   

so hold that pose a while.



   

                   

and i say, this pose,

just tilt your body a little...



   

                   

because people on this side of the theater..



   

                   

and people on this side wanna see you.



   

                   

so tilt your body just slightly like this.

try that, lou.



   

                   

atta boy.



   

                   

you have to do everything possible to win.

you know, no matter what.



   

                   

the day of the contest,

if he comes in his best shape...



   

                   

and he's equally as good as i am...



   

                   

or if, let's say,

he's a few percent better than i am...



   

                   

i spend with him one night.



   

                   

i go downstairs

and book us together in a room...



   

                   

to help him for tomorrow's contest.



   

                   

and...



   

                   

that night...



   

                   

he will never forget.



   

                   

i will mix him up.



   

                   

he will come so ready

to south africa, so strong.



   

                   

but by the time the night is over,

the next morning...



   

                   

he will be ready to lose.



   

                   

i mean i will just talk him into that,

it's no problem to do.



   

                   

so, all those things are available.



   

                   

and if they're available,

you might as well use them.



   

                   

so it doesn't matter

if he comes in shape, or out of shape.



   

                   

lf he comes out of shape,

at least it's less hassle for me.



   

                   

and if he's in shape....



   

                   

fine, i hope he is.



   

                   

but you couldn't pull this with franco.

franco's pretty smart.



   

                   

franco is pretty smart, but franco is a child.



   

                   

when it comes to

the day of the contest, i'm his father



   

                   

he comes to me for advices.



   

                   

so, it's not that hard for me to give him...



   

                   

the wrong advices.



   

                   

pretoria, south africa.



   

                   

probably in an hour or two,

we have a chance to see our room.



   

                   

ten minutes.



   

                   

i promise.



   

                   

can i just ask you one question?

the usual we ask.



   

                   

what must your..



   

                   

special woman look like?



   

                   

it really doesn't matter



   

                   

i like them with black hair,

with brown hair, with red hair



   

                   

with big breasts, with little breasts,

with big ass, with a little ass.



   

                   

if the personality is great

and if they're charming....



   

                   

wonderful, nothing to do,

just lay out in the sunshine.



   

                   

can't wait to get into the sun.

look at that sun out there.



   

                   

we ordered it for you.



   

                   

watch out now, lou.



   

                   

  this is good.

  get ready.



   

                   

holy cow.



   

                   

he likes the oil.



   

                   

hold it up, that a boy, lou.

tense your muscles, louie.



   

                   

pull in your stomach.



   

                   

sometimes when people ask you advice...



   

                   

if you think that they're being arrogant,

or misusing the sport of bodybuilding...



   

                   

you give them kind of pranksterish advice.



   

                   

and that's once happened

in a mr munich contest, i believe.



   

                   

i think it was eight years ago...



   

                   

when some fella came to me

in the gym and said:



   

                   

i want to win mr munich.

i am a perfect poser..



   

                   

and i have a fantastic body.



   

                   

and i just want to learn

a new posing routine, a new style.



   

                   

something way out

which nobody expects.



   

                   

so i said, let me see

your posing routine you have right now.



   

                   

when the guy took his clothes off

and posed for me...



   

                   

he looked like nothing, number one,

and his posing was bad.



   

                   

so i mean, he was just....

i think he was crazy.



   

                   

so i thought, okay,

if he thinks that he's the best poser..



   

                   

i'm gonna pull a little trick on him.

and so that's what i did.



   

                   

i said, listen, i have a new posing routine

from america.



   

                   

i'm in correspondence with

all the top athletes in america. and so on.



   

                   

and i told him that the new thing is...



   

                   

that he has to scream while he's posing.



   

                   

and he looked at me and he says...



   

                   

that's a new idea.

that will really come out impressive.



   

                   

when you go out on stage and scream,

people can't miss you.



   

                   

they'll all look at you screaming, that's it.



   

                   

so i taught him how to scream.



   

                   

first of all, i oiled him up.



   

                   

his body, with really heavy oil

and everything.



   

                   

we're standing there in the shower room.



   

                   

and i taught him how to do it.



   

                   

the higher your arms go up,

the higher you make a screaming noise.



   

                   

and the lower your arms come down,

the lower the noise.



   

                   

this kind of a thing.



   

                   

i practiced with him for around two hours.



   

                   

spent a lot of time on developing

his new posing routine.



   

                   

and he mastered it very well.



   

                   

he was screaming really loud

and high and low.



   

                   

and he went to the mr munich contest.



   

                   

i told him when he walks out,

he has to scream loud, run out.



   

                   

and so he did.



   

                   

and obviously people weren't ready

for that at all.



   

                   

and so, he went out there, screamed loud.



   

                   

went through three or four poses

with loud screaming.



   

                   

they carried him off the stage

and threw him out.



   

                   

they thought the guy was totally nuts.



   

                   

i'm shaking, really.



   

                   

but when i get there,

i think i'll forget about it.



   

                   

  forget about it?

  yeah.



   

                   

when i get there, i'm even more nervous.



   

                   

i'm not nervous at all.



   

                   

thank you.



   

                   

jesus christ.



   

                   

  take it easy.

  what can i say?



   

                   

you guys are psyching me out here

early in the morning.



   

                   

  the only way to do it.

  lay down in the bus in the back.



   

                   

hey, lou. is this the master plan

here this morning?



   

                   

right, be on guard.



   

                   

i'm here now for six days

and nobody invited me for breakfast.



   

                   

this morning they say, come for breakfast

with us, arnold, have a nice breakfast.



   

                   

he's talking about pumping up.

he's talking about psyching me out.



   

                   

she's talking about my mother



   

                   

you're the king of kings, arnold.



   

                   

shit. he's rubbing it in.



   

                   

how are you doing, lou?



   

                   

  how you doing?

  good.



   

                   

look kind of worried today.



   

                   

just a little tired, gotta wake up.



   

                   

  they don't come nicer than you, arnold.

  i'm a nice guy.



   

                   

i wouldn't turn my back on you, arnold,

within ten yards.



   

                   

you don't trust me, why's that?



   

                   

they should have the olympia early on

so we could relax, enjoy the country.



   

                   

they should have it in a month for him.

he isn't even in shape yet.



   

                   

he didn't get the timing right,

i'm telling you.



   

                   

a month from now would have been

perfect for you.



   

                   

but then i would get bigger, too, again...



   

                   

so doesn't matter, what the hell.

let's get it over with.



   

                   

and if you retire this year,

you just never had the olympia.



   

                   

but you had twice the universe,

what the hell.



   

                   

that's not too bad, either



   

                   

you could go on and win the next five years.



   

                   

it's amazing. can you imagine

the feeling i have? six times mr olympia.



   

                   

i told you,

you've found the fountain of youth.



   

                   

you could go on forever



   

                   

  it blows my mind when i think about it.

  people are so tired    



   

                   

i called my mother yesterday already

and i said, i won.



   

                   

she says, congratulations, arnold.



   

                   

anyway, listen, guys, why don't we go?



   

                   

you go and help him pump up.



   

                   

calm him down, help him. okay?

don't screw him up this time.



   

                   

i don't want you in our pumping room.



   

                   

judges.



   

                   

final attention,

you all understand our strict code and rule.



   

                   

no talking whilst adjudicating.



   

                   

and that also means, photographers,

please do not speak to the judges.



   

                   

i'll simply will have to remove....



   

                   

most of the judging at an international

competition takes place during the day...



   

                   

before the crowds and distractions

of the nighttime show.



   

                   

this is called the prejudging.



   

                   

double biceps, rear



   

                   

the judges look for three things:



   

                   

symmetry, proportion and the size

and clarity of each muscle group.



   

                   

olympia contestants

are judged in two classes.



   

                   

those over 200 pounds and those under



   

                   

at night, the two class winners

will pose off for the overall title.



   

                   

each class poses first as a group,

for comparison judging.



   

                   

then they come on one at a time

to perform the six compulsory poses...



   

                   

that show every part of the body.



   

                   

he's so crazy.



   

                   

what a monster



   

                   

oh, my god.



   

                   

these guys are like animals, man.



   

                   

i can't believe it. look at this one now.



   

                   

see, this is the hard part right here,

look at that.



   

                   

and your lats from the rear



   

                   

what's he got? let's see.



   

                   

you can call him the bat from now on.



   

                   

  franco the bat.

  he could fly with that.



   

                   

finish with the left side chest...



   

                   

and your optional routine.



   

                   

nice shot, goddamn it.



   

                   

that guy....

it gives you chills when you watch that guy.



   

                   

i know. isn't it unbelievable?



   

                   

look.



   

                   

ed corney, a 50-year-old nightclub owner

originally from hawaii.



   

                   

he is franco's chief competition

in the under 200 pound class.



   

                   

can you believe that?



   

                   

i mean, that's what i call posing.



   

                   

okay, turn to your right,

serge, face that way.



   

                   

turn right on. look straight ahead.



   

                   

that's it. that's the position we want.



   

                   

an unexpected entry

in the tall class of the olympia contest.



   

                   

serge nubret, thirty years old.
   

                   

mr france,

and a movie and television star in europe.



   

                   

don't lean back too much,

you get wrinkles in the back.



   

                   

  don't go back too much.

  all right.



   

                   

okay, thank you.



   

                   

your back was out of sight.



   

                   

your back, fantastic.



   

                   

do i need more arm?



   

                   

louie, you should've

did this one for your arms.



   

                   

they called it. i didn't wanna look small.



   

                   

you mean this one?



   

                   

no. you're wrong.



   

                   

  okay.

  look, looks like nothing.



   

                   

the arms are important. you've got arms,

and he's got spaghetti arms, louie.



   

                   

i don't have any weak points.



   

                   

i had weak points a few years ago.



   

                   

but my main thing in mind is....



   

                   

my goal always was to even out everything...



   

                   

to the point that everything is perfect.



   

                   

which means if i want to increase

one muscle a half inch...



   

                   

the rest of the body has to increase.



   

                   

i would never just

make one muscle increase or decrease.



   

                   

because everything fits together now.



   

                   

and all i have to do now is get

my posing routine down more perfect...



   

                   

which is almost impossible to do.



   

                   

it's perfect already.



   

                   

yeah, it's down to a point.



   

                   

wait when you see it.



   

                   

relax.



   

                   

thank you, arnold.



   

                   

if you want to be a champion...



   

                   

you cannot have any kind of an outside

negative force coming in and affect you.



   

                   

let's say before a contest,

if i get emotionally involved with a girl...



   

                   

that can have a negative effect on my mind...



   

                   

and therefore destroy my workout.

so i have to cut my emotions off...



   

                   

and be kind of cold, in a way,

before a competition.



   

                   

that's what you do

with the rest of the things.



   

                   

if somebody steals my car

outside of my door right now...



   

                   

i don't care. i can't be bothered with that.



   

                   

i would only have my secretary call

the insurance agency and laugh about it.



   

                   

because i cannot be bothered with it.

i trained myself for that.



   

                   

to be totally cold

and not have things go into my mind.



   

                   

and it was, in a way, a sad story...



   

                   

when my father died.



   

                   

because my mother called me

on the phone, and she said:



   

                   

your dad died.



   

                   

and this was exactly two months

before a contest.



   

                   

she says, you come home to the funeral?

i said, no.



   

                   

it's too late, he's dead,

there's nothing to be done.



   

                   

and i'm sorry, i can't come.



   

                   

and i didn't explain to her

really the reasons why.



   

                   

i had other excuses to her,

because how do you explain to a mother



   

                   

whose husband died, you know, your trip?



   

                   

i didn't bother with it.



   

                   

and that actually caused

one of the greatest conflicts...



   

                   

with my girlfriend.

because she just looked at me and said:



   

                   

it doesn't bother you?



   

                   

i mean, your father died.



   

                   

i never talk about it again.



   

                   

the finals of the mr olympia contest.



   

                   

first to be judged

is the under       pound class.



   

                   

he said    minutes from now, right?



   

                   

  take your time, you got all the time.

  yeah.



   

                   

second place

in the under       pound category...



   

                   

from the united states of america...



   

                   

ed corney!



   

                   

and the winner..



   

                   

of the 1976 mr olympia,

under 200 pounds...



   

                   

from the united states of america, via italy...



   

                   

franco columbu!



   

                   

what did you say, louie?



   

                   

  what did you say?

  i'm training, arnold.



   

                   

  gotta get a good pump.

  you make too much noise.



   

                   

supposed to be very quiet here,

like in a church.



   

                   

tell him.



   

                   

  i can take you.

  keep looking.



   

                   

  thanks a lot.

  you've got a better neck.



   

                   

i know.



   

                   

  i watch you.

  i watch you, too.



   

                   

there's a barbell above my head,

i better watch it here.



   

                   

okay.



   

                   

we don't want no accidents here.



   

                   

what symmetry you've got. you look

like something michelangelo cut out.



   

                   

more oil, more. that's not good oil.



   

                   

  lou, relax.

  would you?



   

                   

  tell them that we're ready.

  we are ready.



   

                   

and now we come to the heavyweights...



   

                   

over 200 pounds.



   

                   

we have three contestants.



   

                   

from the united states of america...



   

                   

lou ferrigno!



   

                   

from france, serge nubret.



   

                   

from the united states via austria...



   

                   

the one and only, arnold schwarzenegger



   

                   

now we'll call on all three contestants...



   

                   

lou ferrigno, serge nubret,

and arnold schwarzenegger..



   

                   

for a pose  down

for the final decision from the judges.



   

                   

louie goes through his posing,

and you watch every pose.



   

                   

you sort of help him out, easy now.



   

                   

each pose he goes through,

you're living it with him.



   

                   

i mean, you just have to try

to understand what i'm trying to tell you.



   

                   

that you're actually

out there with your son...



   

                   

because you trained with him

and you're posing with him.



   

                   

the only thing you're not doing with him...



   

                   

you're not getting

the reward of the applause.



   

                   

he's the one that's getting that,

and he deserves it.



   

                   

and you just hope

the audience gives him more.



   

                   

you wanna shout out,

it's my son out there!



   

                   

give him just a few more handshakes,

a few more applause. 



   

                   

and you just hope

that he's the winner, that's all.



   

                   

third place, from united states of america...



   

                   

lou ferrigno!



   

                   

second place, from france, serge nubret.



   

                   

and the winner..



   

                   

the one and only, arnold schwarzenegger!



   

                   

ladies and gentlemen,

the two body  weight winners...



   

                   

franco and arnold.



   

                   

come on, franco, give him hell.



   

                   

  this little guy he's talking about.

  where is he?



   

                   

turn around.



   

                   

let's go.



   

                   

the winner of the     ...



   

                   

overall mr olympia...



   

                   

the one and only, the greatest...



   

                   

arnold schwarzenegger!



   

                   

louie, you're a baby, lou.

these guys are all veterans.



   

                   

you're just growing.

this takes years and years.



   

                   

in two years, louie,

they'll have never seen anything like you.



   

                   

they'll think you were carved out of stone.



   

                   

just gives you

the motivation to train harder



   

                   

your day will come, louie.



   

                   

someday you'll have a back,

louie, nobody ever seen.



   

                   

so it's no more, because it was

my last year of competition.



   

                   

i would like to announce officially

i'm retiring from bodybuilding competition.



   

                   

i would like to thank you all

for supporting me.



   

                   

i would like to thank the judges.



   

                   

bodybuilding has been

a beautiful experience for me.



   

                   

and i will continue it for the rest of my life.



   

                   

i only stop competing,

but i'm not stopping bodybuilding.



   

                   

it's the greatest sport. thank you.

nice ride.
hushe's idea.
that's right.
how's this side, bossman.
this side's great.
i warden was about you.
you know, if you wasn't out soon.
i would've break in,
that motherfucker pullingl your ass out.
the only excon i know,
who gets out and wants to go back in.
i didn't say, wants.
i said, i would.
there's a difference.
don't spend it all on one place.
we have an escape from
bendwater penitentiary.
step out from the booth,
with your hands in the air!
showtime.
put your hands in the air, now.
hands in the air.
put your hands behind your head,
lock your fingers.
do not move.
a beautiful day.
 what the hell is going on her?
 calm down, warden.
i am lester clark.
i am c.e.o of the cee security.
you may have heard of us?
no?
alright, well..we are an independent
security company.
hired by the
federal bureau prison.
to test the integrity of their,
maximum security, facilities.
nation wide.
this is ray breslin,
he is partner..and uh..
resident houdini.
warden.
now, for the last seven years.
ray has been inserted into every
maximum incarceration facility.
in the system.
he is there to ensure that
each and every one of them is 100 %
escape proof.
and apprently, yours wasn't.
and he got out.
ta dah!
okay, fine.
i suppose, you're gonna tell me
how you did it?
you think he wants to know?
doesn't seem like it.
ray, you are on.
warden, let's start from the top.
any break requires, three things.
knowing the lay out,
understanding the routine and
help from outsiders the realm.
if you know the lay out,
the weak side is obvious.
in bendwaters case...
is the secure housing unit.
with the government expenditure with
state of the art.
the only problem is...
it's located next to
unsecure fire crash.
first, i needed to get inside,
so, i made some enemies.
once inside, it was obvious
you are short staff.
federal guidelines recommend
two guards present when
transfering high risk inmates.
you only use, one.
knowing the guard's routine
was the next step.
my c.o took a smoke break.
there were no eyes on me.
two, three..
after i knew the routine.
all i had to do, was pick a date.
and arrange for a distraction
at the front gate at exactly 4 p.m.
but still at this point,
you're locked inside a steell box
to get out,
you had to have a key code.
you very good chocolate milk.
see, the carton container has
a thin layer of wax linen.
lay it over the keypad to impress
within the key, with four keys to impress.
with the four keys, its just numbers
game to indentify the correct sequence.
i just needed to get to the keypad.
after, i had to cover my tracks,
i had one minute to
make to the fire response shift.
before the team did.
i know the guards were still on the roof,
doing what they do.
which is wasting time.
before you know it,
i am right where i wanna be.
just in time,
to catch my ride.
and your men drove me
right off the grounds.
you have any questions?
yeah, one.
what kind of man would choose to spend
most of his life in prison?
don't take it personally, warden.
over the years, ray has broken out
of 14 like this institutions.
some people has a talent to paint.
some, uh..to sing.
me? i sing.
ray bresler, he posesses a unique
set of skills. he is able break out..
of any prison designed by man.
i take it, you have been good?
yeah. you?
you a good boy inside?
well, of course.
okay..
how did that thing with that guy go?
 what guy?
 what guy.
when i was gone, you were
angry about that there's some guy
some bozo?
 oh, yeah. that bozo ended before dessert.
 that's his loss.
 yeah, they are all lizards.
how many times have i told you that?
you want to get something to eat,
while we get by?
is there a problem?
you're a horrible cook.
that's nice. well...
you can complain in the morning.
ouch!
good morning, sir.
how can i help you?
oh, mr.breslin.
i'm so sorry. i am jules.
that's okay.
you're new here?
no, sir. i've been here 5 months.
 5 months?
 yes, sir.
what have you got for me?
check it out.
that is good.
very smart.
did you do this all by yourself?
i'm impressed.
genious..
you are smart but..
sorry. not smart enough.
don't be bitter.
morning, guys.
abbey?
jessica meyer.
and it's an honour to meet you.
your work is the gold standard in field.
what you've accomplished is remarkable.
(mimes) remarkable.
thank you,
and..you are here because?
she is 'agency', ray.
as in..
central intelligence agency.
 you, a spy?
 worse..i am a lawyer.
ray, hear her out.
she's legit.
i called into langley, myself.
fine, i'll just listen.
go ahead.
mr.breslin..after ending extra ordinary
renditions, the agency is looking
for alternate situations for incarcerating
this sort of people who commit acts
so despicable, they are best..
well...
how can i put it..
 eliminated?
'disappeared'.
we are currently testing a prototype
to deal with people,
no government wants on their books.
but first and formost..
the people financing this, need to
know these facilities are escape proof.
before, the whole systems go online,
globally.
which is really saying is that, none of this
is officially sanctioned by anyone.
close. what i'm saying ms.rose..
is that these facilities
are privately funded and administered.
so, the word 'official' doesn't really apply.
so, if anything goes wrong,
nothing comes back to bite you people in the ass?
whoa, whoa..this is not
..your concern.
 hey! i owe him.
i don't owe you.
my job is to make sure that
the united states is in safe hand.
alright, can we just cut the crap
and call it like it is?
these institutions are off the grid.
with no trials,
there's no convictions;
this people just disappears
and you want him,
to go in and test it?
maybe it's time for me to interject
to the conversation that
they have offered,
double your standard fee.
that's five mils..ray.
in advance.
so, you like this?
look.. i'm the numbers guy.
you are the artist, ray.
and from the financial stand point,
i like it. i like this very much.
beyond the money, mr.breslin.
the people send to this place shouldn't
be allowed out into the real world.
everyone of them is potential
game changer. for the worst.
alright.
 guidelines?
 the usual full works.
alias, cover story..contacts.
evect number.
well, the only differece is
to fully test the security
of the system; it's essential that
non of you know
the location of the incarceration.
 will that present a problem?
 yes. yes, it would.
when do we start?
you just did.
your entered new identity..
would be picked up from this location.
by private contractors
i don't like this.
and, you don't like her.
man, don't flatter yourself.
we are going against every
protocol and guidelines
that you, yourself has insisted on
every single time that you go in.
 and, i don't like her.
 you're right.
she doesn't like anything.
because she's ambitious and greedy.
you say that like its a bad thing.
profile?
okay. name  anthony puertos.
born  madrid.
mother died, when you're 13.
raised by your father, in the u.s
you're suspected of manufacturing
bombs that has been used
in dozen political bombings across
europe and south america
 for the last, 10 years.
 contact onsite?
the warden's name is riordan watch.
 evacuation code?
 310275.
 alright, let's do it.
 tagging.
no, i don't need this.
really.
yeah, you do.
this is not old school.
you think, i'm gonna let you go in, cold?
this gets old.
 man, you're fucked up.
 try it sometime.
sounds good, bossman.
anytime you wanna retire, you know
i've been taking notes.
i'm ready to step up.
where am i gonna find another techno thug
who's as good as you are here?
 a freak of nature.
 yeah, very rare.
there you are baby,
transponder is good.
it's like having me around
in your shoulder.
what elese?
hey, don't forget to write us, alright?
shit.
time to sleep.
prisoner, 17458
puertos..welcome.
to the international detainment, intake.
i am warden hobbes.
where is warden marsh?
there is no warden marsh.
what am i, disoriented..excited?
i guess, that must be it.
and i didn't see a man killed on
a transport helicopter
thrown out of it, right?
mr.portos, your intake is finished.
wait?
my evacuation code is 310275.
 evacuation code?
 yes, evacuation code.
and you giving me a number and..
walk out of here.
free as a bird?
no,
i don't think so.
you come in here, now
you belong to me.
your intake is finished.
wait..wait.
come here, back.
 anything?
 i'm getting cold response, same as yesterday.
you ran a full dinostic on the system?
 twice.
 run it again.
proceed to dock 5.
all prisoners in a block
proceed to dock 5.
portos?
hey,?
go make some friends,
you gonna need them.
damn!
damn!
new fish..we own you.
back off!
last time..?
back away.
poertos?
rothmayar.. emil rothmayar.
i'm really not in hand shaking mood,
right now.
okay...
your name..
the fourth mousketeer.
it's a good name.
why are you in here?
why do you care?
i used to run security for
a guy..
by the name of mannheim.
have you heard of the name?
mannheim..let me see?
no.
 he is a genius.
 really?
he has this habit of taking money from
the rich and giving it to the poor.
 you've heard that story before..
 i've heard the story, yeah.
now, they're trying to find him.
but, i'm not gonna help them.
okay.
so, fuck 'em.
right, fuck 'em.
poertos,
 don't get killed.
 if you say so.
last time they killed a guy in here..
they let his body
rot for three days.
oh..and cancel the prison dance.
wouldn't want to fuck up the prom.
morning, sir.
that's another beautiful piece, sir.
you lied to me.
i lied to you?
 i'm not sure...
 no..no.
you say nothing.
what am i suppose to tell the client
about the man you killed.
that he just jumped?
like you said?
this isn't a free for all.
we are paid to prevent
him from jumping.
and i can't get proof of life,
from a dead man.
so..
you will be dock the entire price
of the asset.
the entire price of the asset
it goes on my months of my pain.
then, you're lucky this man you killed
wasn't high value.
that is all, gerry.
hey, portos..
look at this.
there is no sunrise or sunset,
still, they pray all the time.
don't you find that interesting?
not really.
you look like, the kind of a guy
that find this interesting.
that kind, before?
why all the questions?
it's how i learn things.
you really ought to study
somebody else.
 portos?
 what?
you need a favour?
favour man.
compromising correctional institution
security  ray breslin.
well, for a man who is not interested.
you are doing a lot of looking.
what do you need?
i need to get into the isolation area.
no, you really don't.
yeah, i really do.
call it..a favour.
okay?
okay.
that's your favour?
this one's gonna straight us good.
really?
come on.
let's see what you can do.
alright.
you hit like a vegetarian.
 really?
 you can do better than that.
come on.
 let me see it.
 try this.
you hurt?
 that's good.
 the good one's coming.
relax..let's pretend.
i guess, boys will be boys.
that's enough.
bring them in the barn now.
you can thank me later.
think.
think.
they knew, he was tagged.
of course, they knew.
who do you think, this guys are?
who do you think?
they are a bunch of...
yahoos..from one of those
bop facilities?
this is the shadows world.
these guys, they invented
this shit.
why do you think
they are paying us all that money?
remember, what the guidelines were.
what the fuck are you talking about?
there are no guidelines.
you call that cia bitch.
hush?
motherfucker.
alright..
i'll make the call.
abigail, you gotta keep him..
away from me. alright?
give me your arm.
you will live.
how do a doctor work,
in a place like this?
would you prefer,
there wasn't a doctor here?
where is here?
hey doc, let's wrap it up.
what did he asked you?
he wanted to know his..
dehydration is; compared to the others.
and what did ya tell him?
i don't care.
that's what i told him.
get him out of there!
did you find what you're looking for,
in the box?
all prisoners back to your cell.
all prisoners back to your cell.
who were you before you
came in here, portos?
you are always, watching the room..
always watching everything.
are you asking me,
what i used to do?
yeah.
i'll tell you.
but i need a another favour.
fuck that.
alright, don't do it.
alright, i'm listening.
what's the favour, this time?
i need a piece of metal.
about 3 inches wide..
round, smooth.
oh, no problem.

i'll be right back, okay?
if you get me that piece of metal,
i might be able to get you.
out of here.
tell hobbes, i want to talk.
you've been six months now, mr.rothmayar.
so, you know how this works.
where is victor manheim?
you know to my people,
 he is a hero.
 9 seconds.
do you have a pencil and
a piece of paper?
i could draw you a map.
 of what?
 where you could find him.
you know when i was a kid..
i always wanted to be an artist.
my god, you're pushing it.
the problem was..
i had no talent.
 6 seconds.
 i tried.
 and i tried and tried.
 5..
 do you have dreams?
 4...
did you always wanted to be..
 this?
 2..1!
done.
there.
i told you.
no talent.
records indicate that you are
highly intelligent, huh?
yeah.
as such, i'd have expected you
to see the situation,
and understand it for what it is.
in here, you have no control
over any part of your life.
except, your breathing.
and you just lost that privelege.
get him down.
keep going.
enough.
 what happened?
 nothing.
i am still here.
now, it's your turn.
i break out of prisons,
for a living.
for the past 8 years, i've been breaking
out of facilities
for the federal bereau of prisons.
i think, hobbes been hired
for this place to make it unbreakable.
someone wanted this place tested.
but it was a set up.
they wanted to bury me.
i don't kow who.
but i'm gonna find out.
i need you to set up
another diversion.
what now?
you gotta go back,
in the box.
no fucking way.
wanna get out of here?
okay. i'll do it.
but if i don't get out...
i'll kill you.
fair enough.
the success for a break out
depends on three things.
 layout, routine and..help.
 what if this thing isn't build that way?
it's not.
something under the box,
i think it's a cover.
if it is,
how do we know where it goes?
anyway, i'm gonna find out.
 eat.
 it's disgusting.
the mind of an inmate works
differently than someone on the outside.
he sees things differently.
the architecture is vertical.
the cell blocks, the outer locks..
the box, the mess...
everything is in large vertical compartment.
the best guess is they build down underground,
in large natural fixtures.
like caves.
if i can get in there.
follow where it goes,
i just might find out a way to the surface.
if you are right,
how do you dug a metal?
it don't cut, don't cut at all.
this place is subterrenial.
there's moisture in the air.
whoever build this place,
should've used aluminium.
which means, the whole panelling
is done with steel.
steel rust over time.
the way around that is concentrating
the heat to boost through this.
this will panel with snap right
the fuck off.
 concentrated heat?
 yeah. with the piece of metal you gave me.
we exposed it with the toothpaste
polished to rinse the metal.
 to some heat.
 with the lamps at the box.
right.
at a 100 degree centigrate steel
on those panel with 3 cubic centimeter
those bolt will come right off.
what?
 you don't look so smart.
 you don't either.
see most prison are locked
to small towns.
with an hour or more,
we need supplies and workforce.
now, if i get to the surface,
i don't who can take me over the wall.
but first, i'm gonna need that
diversion in the box.
how much time do you need then?
no problem.
 step back.
 i know you.
you don't know shit.
you can't see that.
now, step back.
i know half of your brother.
right.
your mother,
she was my favourite whore in marrakech.
man, she could polish that horn..
damn!
you're killing me!
you're killing me!
what is he onto?
hey, shut the fuck up.
you german dog!
just hold him till i get there.
hey, i got a camera
malfunction in box 2.
roger that.
just reboot the system.
shit!
should we restrain and drug him, sir?
not yet.
lights off, box 4.
a rough day, mr.rothmayar?
here's what you should know.
i don't care, sooner or later
you will tell me what i want to know.
it's inevitable.
like dying.
know this,
there will come a point;
where i don't give a shit about you..
or whatever the fuck
you think you are doing right now.
so, have a lovely day, mr.rothmayar.
report.
valve breach on level two sir.
electrical malfunction.
sir?
 did you make it?
 yeah.
where are we?
 where are we?
 i don't know.
they froze the check.
what are we talking about here?
the payment for ray's services.
they froze the check.
not frozen, it's on hold.
alright, it's very common.
 on 2.5 million dollar transaction.
 no..no, no.
common would be a week,
maybe 10 days.
 this has been way longer than that.
 listen abbey.
it's the federal government.
you know how they work.
 did you call that woman?
 yeah, i called. everything's fine.
then, where is he?
he is on the job,
that he was hired to do.
so, you're saying
it's all good?
it's all good.
where was the breach?
the auxiliary balance system sank outside.
premise 5 and 7 has been compromised.
navigation ventilation is shocked on box 2.
portos?
layer is full of rust.
water pressure must've
snapped em clean off.
maybe.
portos isn't his name, is it?
why wasn't i alerted?
our client's been paying lots of money
to make sure that facility is unbreakable.
now, he is there to proove that,
not even he
can get out. now you make sure
he's there forever.
do you have a problem with that?
no. no, not at all.
just the opposite.
fucker.
there's one more thing.
the chinese bank..
have joined the brazillians, the russians
the english and the u.s
and the swiss banks they're all paying
to find about the whereabout of
this man heimler fellow.
word on the street is that
he's developed
a programme to turn the entire
world banking system
into fucking confederate.
rothmayar worked with that
asshole, he knows where he is.
your job, is to get that
information out of him.
well, it just so happens that
since breslin has got close to rothmayar,
rothmayar has developed a new edge,
to his defiance that was not
there before.
i think breslin is to blame.
 then, break breslin.
 thank you.
i have an assignment
i know you will enjoy.
get on your feet!
wakey, wakey.
talk to me.
come on,
you must fight.
get up!
stay on your feet.
if we're on a ship.
we would know.
no. not if you're over a
thousand feet long.
we wouldn't know a damn thing.
wakey, wakey.
get him on his feet.
you can do it.
 you are gonna do it.
 can't get out of here.
 yes, we can.
 no!
get on your feet.
stop it now, ray.
don't give up.
don't let them break you.
what made you want
to spend your life in prison?
hmm?
tell me?
what made you do it?
tell me!
i was a lawyer,
a prosecutor.
the man that i put away,
made a promise to me.
this man thought about this promise
everyday for three years.
planning his way out of prison.
planning on how
he's gonna keep his word;
taking a man's life is nothing.
taking his heart?
that's everything, isn't it?
everything.
you see, putting people in prison
wasn't good enough.
i had to.
i wanted to..
make sure they stay in there.
not getting out.
i understand.
i have a daughter.
never forget that.
you have a choice.
you can die in here...
or you can get out with me.
punishing,
who put you here.
 you hear me?
 yeah.
yeah.
good news and bad news.
i was thinking about
that first meeting.
privatized incarceration.
off the grid,
international profile..
and i started digging.
code name  the tomb.
completely for profit.
totally, legal.
run by ex-military assholes.
blackwater rejects..
you know bad dudes.
if ray is anywhere, it's here.
where is here?
that's the bad news.
i don't know.
we need access to any layout.
no blind times.
we are in the middle of
the fucking ocean.
i wouldn't be content
if we didn't find our team.
they've scrambled the guards shift
so they are never the same.
but they can't change the routines
of the guards themselves.
we don't know where they start.
we don't know when they end.
but i do know
where they're gonna be..
based on habit.
see the guy coming down the stairs,
see how he's walks
all pigeon toe?
 the duck.
 yeah, well..
yeah, the duck always
work with the guy with grey on his neck.
 hives.
 yeah, hives.
when duck and hives work together,
they always do it circular.
and they do it,
at random times a day.
it doesn't matter when they do it.
it always end up getting
a 120 strides each.
then, they spit up.
watch.
now, they each take a side.
duck walks 53 strides,
hives 65, then they meet up at the top.
the guard down there at the bottom.
that heavy set guy,
he doesn't move much.
my guess is he hasn't been here a while,
and only does what he has to do.
louisa.
 louisa?
 his standing style reminds
me of my first girlfriend.
nice.
that guard over there
could create a problem for us.
 he is always looking around.
 the chicken man.
chicken man, right.
my guess, chick is new here.
does everything by the book.
how do you know
when the shift ends?
i don't.
around this time, your girlfriend
louisa starts looking at her watch.
my guess,
it's lunch time.
 welcome back.
 thanks.
but now that we got the routine,
we just got to ask
the good doctor,
where the hell we are.
i'm not permitted to give you
anything for the pain.
so, don't request it.
hey, doc..
you took an oath.
'according to my ability and judgement'
'i'll protect my patients from
harm and injustice'.
what exactly is that you
want from me?
i wanna know,
where the hell i am.
it's okay, it's under control.
put him back here.
sorry.
 so?
 no luck.
push him harder.
pushing him is no hopes.
what are the options?
planb.
you always gotta have a planb.
did you get it?
now, i need his glasses.
sir?
take a look at this.
it's a makeshift sextant.
will it work this?
it works.
it's? horizon.
but it will only give us
half of our location.
bring breslin.
ill explain how it works later,
but first, we gotta get this outside.
watch out there.
welcome to your new hole,
mr.breslin.
actually, i've been waiting for?
you know who i am?
i do, now.
i've studied your work,
very closely.
it's quite brilliant.
as a matter of fact...
it is what i used as reference guide
in designing..
this facility.
if you know what i am.
let me go.
no, no, no..no. mr.breslin,
it's not how this works.
not this time.
you see, the people who paid
for you to be here;
want for you forever.
and knowing that,
knowing who you are..
well, who you were.
i can't have you
communicating with rothmayar.
or with anybody else,
for that matter.
this is the reality.
and there is no way out.
this can go, two ways.
you let me go and i'll pretend
this never happened. if you don't..
i'll burn this fucking place
to the ground on my way out.
effective right now.
no mess, no rec time and
no showers.
i can get you victor mannheim.
rottmayer trust me.
so, you say.
 not good enough.
 what've you got to loose?
finding him can be worth a lot more
than what you're paying for me.
 right, hobbes?
 it's a nice idea but...
as it stands right now,
i'm in line to get both.
you will never break rottmayer.
he'll die before he turns.
i'm the only chance
to get what you want.
i want mannheim and his whole network.
names, locations in real time.
get back and if it checks out,
i'll let you go.
but know this..
you tell me every word that
you and rottmayer shares or
i will personally pull
the fucking life out of you.
fair enough.
so, what happened?
i'm playing you.
last night, rottmayer tole me he started
his network with 5 guys
in his hometown.
he said, he could trust his life
with this guys.
give javed the sextant.
show him how to use it.
and tell him,
it's his ticket out of here.
javed?
he would rather see us dead.
he'll be the last one they suspects.
the (?) network caused the bank collapse
in iceland six years ago.
i don't give a shit about
six years ago.
i wanna know where he is now.
you wanna die?
do you wanna get out?
today?
 they are planning an escape.
 an escape?
really? who and when?
i don't know the details.
just some.
tell me the details you know.
you get me fixed first.
mr.alfredo..affidi, or whoever the fuck
your name is.
your opiate drug cartel friends
have paid a lot of money
for you to be here.
of course, they did.
those fucks.
so, aside from your freedom,
what else can i give you?
i want the guards
to leave my people alone.
the holy quran
i want one in my cell.
and i want to say
the name of allah..
and the prophet mohammad in the open air.
i want to be seen by my god.
when i say my evening prayers.
that's all?
that's all.
i wanna be seen by my god, mr.hobbes.
 .....
 north or south?
the water basins turn clockwise,
above the equator, means we're in north.
did we get the longitude?
the batch of fish in yesterday,
he said it's november 20th.
without warm air,
or sea, november.
how do you build a secret facility
and put it underwater.
you have a terrific reason
toward northern latitude.
cos you wanna avoid rough water.
so, you're gonna stay away
from the carribean and pacific sea.
and you stick to china sea.
if i was a betting man
i'd say it could be off the coast of morocco.
it's just a guest.
in any case, its close to that sea.
that's my educated guess.
i know a guy there, a casablanca,
who owes me big time.
enough to come and get you?
 huh, he'd still owe me.
is there a way to get a message out?
my god.
what is this?
you swallowed a clotting powder?
listen to me.
i know you think,
i'm playing you.
in hobbes's office,
there is a book.
compromising in correctional institution
security by ray breslin,
on page 8 is a detailed description of
cell block c of lewisberg federal prison.
 guards?
 check it out.
and remember your oath.
i can't stall hobbes anymore.
 i gotta give him more location.
 we still doesn't have a plan.
it's in the doctor's hands.
the hippocratic oath
guards?
bring me prisoner portos.
from a block.
hobbes's orders,
do it now.
breathe in.
okay.
i saw the book.
how did you know?
what do you want me to do?
the doctor is in.
now, javed has to do his part.
the man you hunt's base of operation
is 20 miles outside sierra russo.
that's on the bulgarianromania border.
see?
ratting out a friend ain't so hard.
we got 24 hours, before hobbes realizes
that the bulgarian location is bullshit.
who do we know in c block?
you've got permission
for your midnight prayer?
so, what do you have for me?
 lock in breslin.
 yes sir.
what are you up to?
looking for a way to finish hobbes.
louder...
louder.
gotcha!
decode it.
i need you in 24 hrs 30 degrees 22 (n)
bbq and pool party.
don't forget to tell the kids. bring all toys.
 rottmayar.
stop it.
zoom in.
its mcmayer's son.
breslin is gonna have the sons help
breaking from cell block c.
we have the time frame.
and we have a location.
cell block c.
triple the guard force there.
i wanna know everyone
who is involved here.
you will sir.
p.a: cell block c prepare for inspection.
cell block c prepare for inspection.
louisa and chicken man.
they sent everyone else
to cell block c.
you better be fucking right.
don't worry.
hey, you fucking white trash
scumbag's bitch!
where's do you think
you're fucking..

the riot was suppose to break
from block c.

to babylon.
right now.
come on.
where the fuck is breslin?
go, go..go.
let's move.
we got 11 minutes to get to the top
let's hope the doc has made contact.
what are you doing?
all the cameras are connected.
we gotta block them out.
sir?
say, cheese!
fire ventilation.
let's go.
engage security protocol 5.
we're out gunned.
the walls are locked outside.
they are out of moves.
drake, take two men.
drag the rats back to cages.
javed!
open gate 3!
go, go..go!
don't fucking loose them.
breslin.
we gotta move.
as soon as that door's down.
i'll cover you guys from the other side.
breslin, how the hell did
they know where we are?
you turned off the cameras, right?
motion detector.
sir?
out.
you can play your games all day, mr.breslin.
but i am still in control.
whatever you do,
i have the power.
i own your ass.
you guys can get up that ladder.
i gotta find the engine room.
we shut the power and wait them down.
those magnetic glasses door
open for about 5 seconds,
before the backup generator
kicks in. you understand?
it's all the time you're gonna have.
take this, take it.
you are a good man.
go for it.
what about you?
i'll be right behind you.
but what if you're not up
there on deck in 5.
do what you gotta do.
there's always plan b.
come with me, let's do it.
i'm dead man.
there is no way out.
you're coming with me.
i'll carry you up there.
 i'm not gonna leave you behind.
 give me your gun.
just give me your gun.
i'll see you up there.
now, go.
take care.
 report.
 fuck you, motherfuckers.
we are taking gunfire
at the lower deck.
if they're at lower deck
it's going to be their exit route.
meet me at the engine room.
i'm coming down.
copy.
 get that fucker out.
 yes, sir.
yeah. whatever.
come on.
i'll fucking kill you, motherfucker!
 yeah, he is here.
 we are on our way.
 i'll take care of it.
 no, wait..wait!
what the fuck?
 fuck me.
 no one gets off this ship.
we have to move now!
not yet.
give yourself up, mr.breslin.
give a look around,
make some noise.
this is no cell block.
you can't get out.
not really.
i know about your wife...
your son.
i know every detail.
so, thank you.
for pointing out all the small flaws
in my creation.
i'll be sure to fortify them.
cos your time is up.
you hear me?
breslin?
your time is up.
go in there.
search every inch of this fucking room.
breslin?
go, down!
rottmayar!
gun!
 gun?
 give me your gun.
boom.
have a lovely day.
asshole.
now, what?
relax.
 you met her before.
 jessica miller.
it's an honour to meet you.
your work is a gold standard in field.
she's been my eyes and ears
inside the agency.
hello, dad.
and she's also my daughter.
hello, darling.
thank god, you made it.
i've missed you.
what happened?
oh, nothing.
don't worry about it.
you are mannheim.
didn't see that coming.
you shouldn't.
yeah.
how did you do it?
we have code names.
code name rottmayar, meant
maximum security incarceration.
when my dad was picked up.
it activated the code.
 and that's when you...
 i needed the best.
and after you agreed to do it.
i used my contact deep inside
the dhs to get you in.
and the name you gave me
was the id code?
portos.
rottmayar, emil rottmayar.
and i became your best friend.
you are not easy friend to have there.
i mean, i had to work very hard.
that damn box.
i mean, that was hot.
didn't think you had warm yet.
but it doesn't matter.
what matters is that i am out,
so are you.
don't sweat for no time.
you wanna try it again?
you son of a bitch.
 i hope, i never see you again.
 well, that hurts.
one more thing.
 how much does les really know?
 only what i told him at first.
but the next thing i know,
he's going around me
and offered his services
to the backers of the tomb.
so, he knew where i was being sent?
he arranged your transport.
you need a ride?
no, thanks.
i've made my own arrangements.
it wasn't tracking.
we knew something wasn't right.
red flags going up all over the place.
clark was too calm about it.
so, we started digging.
we found out,
he'd been offered the ceo job
of running the whole
tomb programme.
as a prototype, he would bear the proof
that it was inescapable.
with a salary of 5 million a year
plus stock options.
tell me, you've tracked
him down.
just like you asked.
the plan is in motion as we speak.
sleeping time, motherfucker!
oh, fuck!
hush.
what did he say?
it's all good.
good.
 what's that?
 job offers.
ignore them, maybe later.
why don't you and me
have a very special dinner?
no, i'll cook.
haven't i suffered enough?

keep this sucker steady, toll!
  i'm doin' my best!
here we go!

it's stuck on 10,000 feet.
  hydraulics?
  what hydraulics?
congratulations.

that's real chinese takeout.
floor it. i'm homesick.
you got it.
yes! i love this song! whoo!
juliet! two.
christmas... my friend...
please tell me
you ain't goin' through with this.
course i am. look at that girl.
who wouldn't marry 'er?
she cheated on you.
  it was a half cheat.
  which is?
the other side of a half truth.
  the facts are murky.
  murky.
i hate to break this to you, pal,
but your girlfriend over there
has a world class cheatin' gene.
  i should stab you in the heart.
  too late.
hi, cheers.
you know, i used to think
you had a black heart.
black is too colorful.
  hey, babe.
  hey.
  hey, barney.
  hey, lacy.
promise next time not to keep
my baby away so long?
cross my heart.
if he had one.
look who's lost in space.
got a pen?
hey!
you got anything
that doesn't have skulls on it?
matter of fact, i don't.
einstein's theory
of special relativity.
only i made it better.
believe it or not, before gunner became
chemically unbalanced,
he went to mit, had a master's degree
in chemical engineering.
this idiot actually had a brain,
you believe that?
  well, what happened?
  he quit to be a bouncer.
i wanted to get close to this girl
who danced at this disco.
yeah, i can't believe
she dumped you.
  wouldn't you?
  i would, yeah.
  can we talk outside?
  yeah, sure. let's go.
  how do i put this?
  just be straight up. honest.
i feel, uh...
i'm not sure what i feel.
this life... it's not for you, is it?
i thought it was.
you gave me a chance to be one o' you,
and you got my respect forever.
and you got my respect, too.
what are you gonna do?
well, i'd like to finish out the month.
then i wanna go
meet up with my girlfriend.
  where's she from?
  she's, uh, she's french.
believe it or not, i met 'er
in afghanistan. she was a nurse.
  that comes in handy.
  yeah. and you'd like 'er.
you know, she's the kind o' person
you wanna do things for.
that's why i took this job,
cause the money's great and 
now i can afford to get 'er
everything she deserves...
it's one o' those things
that just feels right.
well, you know, when you can be with someone
and you don't even have to talk.
you already know what they're thinkin'.
you ever had that?
sure.
i don't want you to think that
i'm desertin' you.
no, listen. if i had to do it
all over again at your age,
i'd be doin' what you're doin'.
why don't you
freshen up that beer?
all right.
barney... ross.
what do you want from me, church?
not too good in the memory category,
are you, barney?
you made a deal with me.
you gave me your word.
and you end up
blowin' up half of vilena,
punchin' holes and a bowie knife
through a fellow cia agent,
even if he was a dirtbag.
but what breaks my heart...
is that you stole 5 million dollars
from me.
and for all this male pattern badness,
i could've put you in the deepest,
darkest hole in gitmo.
no sunlight.
  but i kept you out.
  great.
because i knew the day would come
when you were gonna pay me back.
today... is that day.
keep talkin'.
a chinese plane got shot down
over the mountains
near a hell hole called gasak.
  yeah? who shot it down?
  take a guess.
on board that plane is a safe carrying something
you don't need to know about.
all you need to know is
you can't let it fall into the wrong hands.
now, you're gonna go in there,
and you're gonna get the contents
of that safe before anyone else.
you're gonna bring it to me.
it should be
a walk in the park for you.
and then we're even.
we'll get to that.
the safe in that plane
is very high tech.
the access code changes
every 120 seconds.
you use the wrong code,
it blows.
  so we need to get you in...
  wait, wait.
"we". who's "we"?
who are you workin' with?
that's none o' your business.
let's just call our host
the corporation.
all right?
i'm sending along a pro
who specializes in this type o' situation.
her name is maggie chang.
a woman.
that usually goes along
with the name maggie, yeah.
forget it.
she can handle herself.
but let me be clear.
if anything happens to her,
she gets a hangnail,
she gets hurt,
she gets roughed up,
she doesn't come back in
exactly the same condition she went in,
you and your little gang of psychotic mutts
will never be seen again.
and that, i promise you.
i don't make
a very good babysitter.
don't sell yourself short.
you're gonna make
a very good babysitter.
be there at 7:00.
hey. i'm maggie chang.
  you're barney ross?
  yeah.
  mr. church told you about me?
  said you wanna tag along?
help, not tag along.
nice motorcycle.
where we're goin' is new.
we don't know what to expect.
is it custom?
i think it's a mistake,
you comin' along.
build it yourself?
yeah, i built it myself.
are you playin' games with me, maggie?
no. are you playing games with me?
church told me what you said.
i'm combat proficient.
i don't need a babysitter.
  so... when do we leave?
  05:00.
nice meeting you.
  she's into me.
  she hates you.
watch this.
um...
you know, if somethin' happens to her,
it's comin' back on us.
did you ever think
to ask me for my opinion?
i told you 10 times before, i didn't have a choice,
unless you don't mind goin' to jail.
yeah, well, church intimidated you.
  really?
  yeah.
oh, is that the woman
you can never fully trust callin' again?
you know,
i will stab you one day.
hey, baby.
yeah, course
i'm thinkin' about you.
what else is there to think about?
hopeless.
hey.
you were in the army, right?
i can tell.
yes, ma'am. three years.
last tour was afghanistan,
kunar province.
  didn't like it any more?
  uhh... long story.
  i would like to hear it.
  all right.
i, uh, i was trained as a sniper,
and an instructor, too,
but... i actually wanted to mix it up,
get in on the action.
uh, this one time, we're stuck out
in this hell hole valley.
about 30 taliban opened up
from these houses in the hills above us.
and they got about eight of us
pinned down bad.
so i called in for artillery support.
but... "no way", says the captain.
didn't wanna endanger the locals.
so we scattered. some crawled to a ditch,
some... to the dry riverbed and the rest bailed, but...
we were still stuck in the kill zone.
and we battled for...
i don't know, three hours.
and finally, an apache gunship chopper
showed up to provide air cover.
scattered the hadjis, but...
smoke clears and four of my squad are dead
in the ditch and two in the riverbed.
yeah, i was... mad and sick,
all dead for nothin'.
you know,
the most... screwed up thing of all...
is when i got back to base that night,
i found out that they had shot
this stray dog that i adopted.
commander's orders to get rid
of all animals on the base.
i mean, you'd think we had enough damn
shootin' for one day, you know?
and, anyway,
i, uh, i figured it was time to move on.
i heard these guys were lookin'
for someone, and here i am.
you got that transponder?
  yes. apparently, 15 kilometers northwest.
  okay.
oh, hello, darlin'.
hello, darlin'.
i'm a little busy. can i...
let's move.
we're in and outta here fast.
the sooner, the better.
  billy the kid.
  yeah?
today's your lucky day.
you get to take point.
my pleasure, sir.
impressive.
hold on.
  remember when you could do that?
  no, do you?
i could blow 'im away
if i needed to.
really? look down.
look down.
you see what i see? short legs.
a thousand bucks you can't catch 'im.
go on, flash.
  i'm a little busy.
  are you?
found the wreck
at the bottom of the hill, sir.
slow it down, billy.
you're makin' us look bad.
  say it again, over?
  you heard.
  roger that. slowin' it down.
  we appreciate it.
  rest o' the plane's over the hill, sir.
  good work, billy.
looks like somebody had a bad day.
you guys go to the right.
take off, rover.
a'it, billy.
you get a vantage point up there.
there's fur in their hands.
these guys were alive
until the wolves got to 'em.
be careful.
is this it?
yes, it's here.
caesar! i need you in here.
caesar, grab a hold of this thing.
i think it's spring loaded.
lee, hook it on.
now, on the count of three,
let's pull it back.
ready?
one... two... three.
  we can't hold this.
  you have to.
come on, maggie!
  something's wrong.
  what?
the explosive timer's triggered.
  how long?
  fifty four seconds!
if we leave now, we'll make it.
  maggie, let it go!
  no, i can do it!
come on, maggie!
man, what's goin' on?
she tripped the detonator.
stay back!
i'm losin' my grip!
you do, she's cut in half.
  come on, maggie!
  got it!
  yeah, lucky i was here.
  just thinkin' that.
i'm sorry.
it's important i get this.
you got guts. no common sense.
but guts. c'mon.
it's all right. we got it.
let's go. you're strong.
billy! come on down.
we're outta here.
what happened?
that woman is crazy,
but i got a good pump.
aren't you curious
about what's inside the case?
nah, i just wanna get church
off our back.
billy the kid!
where the hell is he? billy!
  drop your weapons!
  no way.
it ain't happenin'.
no?
are you sure?
i'm sorry, sir.
they were waitin'.
  drop the weapons now.
  don't do it.
he's a strong soldier.
let's see how strong he is.
do it.
  no!
  oh ho ho!
don't do nothin' he says!
don't talk.
you should not speak.
i'm gonna kill 'im.
when i fire,
his head... will be gone.
three seconds.
don't give your weapons.
you don't owe me anything!
one.
two.
don't do this!
they'll kill everyone!
he's gonna kill 'im.
et numero trois...
drop 'em!
i'm impressed.
very good use of intelligence.
everybody stay calm, we'll be done soon
and then we'll be on our way.
bring me that knife.
what's this symbol?
i like symbol.
this is the symbol of the goat.
the pet of satan...
they say.
  you have a case that belongs to me.
  does it?
yes, like your lives.
it was lost. he doesn't have it.
last time the case,
or you will force me
to cut...
his heart... out.
do it, you piece o' shit.
wait!
let me have it.
hey!
  you talkin' to me?
  pick it up.
  hand it to me.
  go get it yourself.
  what was that?
  you heard.
now pick it up,
hand it to me nicely,
or you'll get what he got.
do it, lee.
you'll be all right, billy.
respect is everything.
without respect, we're just people.
common, shitty people.
i'm sorry, sir.
it's not your fault.
now what?
we're both fighting men.
and i respect that.
and fighting men...
they don't deserve
to be killed like sheep.
but...
respect...
must be taught.
lie down with your face
on the ground until we leave.
don't challenge me.
get down.
are you afraid of me?
no. i'm not.
you should be.
  i'm dyin'.
  don't talk, billy.
cut his hands loose!
the letter.
in my pocket.
a'it, kid. i got it.
i got it.
  i'm so sorry.
  i believe you.
what was in the case?
a computer.
blueprint of a mine.
a mine? what mine?!
the russians stored nearly 5 tons
of weapons grade plutonium.
the mine was abandoned after the cold war.
no one knows it's there.
the blueprint shows
where the plutonium is stored.
we want to stop it
before it gets in the wrong hands.
i guess that didn't happen, did it?
this kid died
so some dirtbag can make bombs.
i'm so sorry.
not as sorry as i am.
let's take care of 'im.
"dear sophia"
"i wish i could find something different
to do besides just missing you,"
"but i can't."
"the team's treating me good.
we got each other's backs."
"and i want you to know that
wherever i end up,"
"i'll be wantin'
the very best for you."
"and if some miracle happens,
and i come back again,"
"i hope i'm still your man.
much love, billy."
why is it that the one of us...
who wants to live the most,
who deserves to live the most, dies?
and the ones that deserve to die,
keep on living?
what's the message in that?
what's the plan?
track 'im, find 'im, kill 'im.
cz 1492, come on.
requesting a response immediately.
who's this bozo?
cz 1492, this is
a secure air wave. do you read?
what's this about?
what's taking so long,
barney ross?
this should have been a walk in the park
for you guys. where's the case?
don't have it.
i warned you what would happen
to you mutts if you pulled this shit again.
a good man died
tryin' to get that case.
  i'm sorry about that.
  are you?
yes, as a matter of fact, i am.
but this sort o' situation comes
with the territory, wouldn't you say?
and so does payback.
you know, church, you're the kinda guy
that pulls the strings,
and everyone else
does your dirty work
cause you never had the guts
to do it yourself.
we're done.
sir... we got a problem.
the digging has slowed down.
too many are dying.
they're exhausted.
he's tired.
anybody else tired?
get more workers.
we've already taken most
of the men from the villages.
get all the rest.
women, children, all of them.
show me.
now we know where it is.
right, right.
okay. i know what to do.
good. i want the plutonium out
in three days.
three days?
i have people ready
to pay four million a kilo now.
three days. no more.
understood.
you're smart.
imagine if 6 pounds of pure plutonium
is powerful enough to change
the balance of the world.
so, imagine what 5 tons would do.
it's very interesting. yeah?
  something's happening.
  what?
the transmission stopped.
they're underground.
puttin' it down right here.
come on, let's hustle, hustle.
we gotta move.
christmas! come on, lee. do you even know
what the hell you're doin'?
five minutes.
  don't get your knickers in a twist.
  right.
another transport truck.
could be one o' theirs.
let's check this place out.
no shootin'.
  classics?
  yeah.
  i've been dyin' to use these.
  we'll beat the truth outta 'em.
maggie, you tell the guys
to wait in the truck.
okay.
  they're here.
  yeah.
speak english?
  he's slightly gigantic.
  so?
just sayin'.
  he's really gigantic.
  i said that.
hey!
can't beat a classic.
i say we beat some info
outta these guys and get movin'.
  sounds good to me.
  let's start with the midget.
calm down, boys. i can get
them to talk with much less effort.
what's she gonna do,
give him a pedicure?
it's a little sick.
christmas,
i need you to hotwire that truck
and go back to the plane
and get the weapons.
why don't you get
one o' those cheese heads to do it?
stop complainin'.
i should've bounced
one o' these over your skull.
  how'd it go?
  we're on. let's move.
cheese heads.
they call themselves sangs.
they say they control
everything east of the mountains.
robbery, kidnapping, assassinations...
basically, a cartel for hire.
  how do you know the language?
  easy. put it together.
it's a cross between
ukraine and bulgarian dialect.
impressed?
a little.
christmas!
  what?!
  why are you yellin'?
cause you gave me
the shit job, that's why.
i'm gonna shoot you in the face
when i see ya.
where are you?
the 60 year old death trap
you call a plane.
well, what's takin' so long?
cause there's bridges out,
signs missing.
i've been drivin' these dire roads
for the last seven hours!
you done complainin'?
thanks for the sympathy.
this is weird.
just like home.
that figures.
what the hell is this place?
i believe
it's an old soviet army base.
probably used in the 80's... cold war...
they most likely staged maneuvers
and practice attacks against the u.s. here.
is there anything you don't know?
great. just what i need.
we'll bed down here for the night.
ogh...
this tastes like shit.
how's yours?
can't complain about rigatoni.
plan ahead, fellas.
that's all i have to say.
y'all, what if you knew
you were gonna die tomorrow?
what would your last meal be?
  one choice.
  one choice?
  it'd probably be cereal for you, huh?
  and what the hell's wrong with cereal?
it's cliche.
you gotta be original. you know,
if you were an original, broad thinking man,
you'd probably come up
with some special cereal, like earios.
you know, just like your ear.
you know, pour milk on them suckers,
they just lay there and
you don't hear shit.
for the record...
my hearing is 20/20.
barney?
donuts and most food that kills ya.
  that's deep, man.
  oh... you think so?
maggie?
crispy aromatic duck with plum sauce.
very sexy.
but i like italian, too.
i'm startin' to think
italian's overrated.
hey. what about me?
my favorite swedish dinner would be...
baby seal... and whale ass...
in the summer.
but i'd really die... for some chinese.
then you're gonna starve to death.
all right, sweet dreams.
hey, barney.
i'm not done eatin', man.
  can i ask you something?
  sure, go ahead.
why are you so nervous around me?
  i don't get nervous, maggie.
  what is it then?
i just like keepin' a distance.
is it because you don't want
to know any more people?
let's just say bad things have happened
to people i've gotten close to.
not a good way to live.
i know.
do you think about
the young man who died?
all the time.
  you don't talk about him much.
  no, that's how we deal with death.
we can't change what it is,
so we keep it light until it's time to get dark.
and then we get pitch black.
understand?
i understand.
good night.
good night, maggie.
i swear to god, if he doesn't stop snorin',
i'm gonna shoot 'im.
gunner!
you rang?
i know it's a stupid question.
i don't suppose
you have any more o' that coffee.
  pot only makes one cup.
  yeah. that's what i figured.
listen up.
those guys said the congregation of sangs
are probably in this area,
concentrated east.
so, that's where we're goin'.
we're outta here in 10 minutes.
you get ready.
do what you gotta do.
houston? we got a problem.
down!
we gotta get outta here!
  go!
  go, go go!
go, go, go, go!
go!
save your ammo.
where the hell are you?
i'm almost there.
hey, what's goin' on?
are those shots?
yeah.
  what's happenin'?
  the sangs got us pinned down.
  can you hold 'em off?
  yeah, maybe with a tank.
  oh, shit.
  what?
they got a tank.
c'mon. c'mon! c'mon!
oh!
let's roll! c'mon!
i'm out.
one left. why not?
hey, who did that?
not me, i'm out.
hey, what just happened?
  somebody got a little carried away.
  it looks that way.
where are the shooters?
i don't know, but if they wanted us dead,
we'd be dead.
barney?
don't freak out.
small world, huh, barney?
booker?
rumor had it you were dead.
yeah, i heard that, too.
so, how's life treating ya?
been better.
  you did all this?
  i fly solo. i thought you knew that.
yeah, i heard it,
but i didn't buy it.
well, now you do.
this your team?
yeah. gunner, toll road,
hale caesar and maggie.
booker... you're the one
people call the lone wolf?
i've been called that.
but i have mellowed.
not that much.
i heard another rumor,
that you were bitten by a king cobra?
yeah, i was.
but after five days of agonizing pain,
the cobra died.
hey, booker.
great to see you, man.
so, how'd you wind up
in this godforsaken place?
we got ambushed by sangs
about 100 kilometers east of here,
killed one o' my men,
young kid.
  yeah, sorry to hear that.
  yeah.
the sangs are the lowest form o' scum.
  shootin' them has been a good business.
  do you know who the leader is?
  yeah, a guy named vilain.
  vilain.
mm hm. yeah, he pretty much controls
everything in this area.
you're gonna need more men
if you expect to get out alive.
  can you help out?
  ah, sorry, barney. i work alone.
i understand.
thanks for showin' up.
my pleasure.
hey, barney!
there's a village down the road.
they're good people,
and they hate the sangs.
  maybe they can help out.
  thanks.
happy hunting.
what happened?
i'm still alive.
that's a matter of opinion.
what'd i miss?
i'll tell you about it on the way.
come on, guys. unload these weapons.
looks like christmas
came way late this year.
  yeah, i love you, too.
  well, i'm happy to see you.
finally. somebody with class.
this gotta be the town
that booker was talkin' about.
i could retire to a place like this.
clean air, no stress, raise some kids...
you know, maggie,
i could retire to a place like this.
you are so full o' shit.
out, out, out!
they're missin' us by a mile.
  put down guns.
  that's not happenin'.
whoa!
the safest place is
in front of their gun.
  we will shoot you!
  no! wait.
these guys are here to help.
they want to help.
even you two rejects
could get lucky around here.
  you think?
  i doubt it.
do you mind?
who you are?
  we're americans.
  since when?
swedish.
  blackfoot.
  chinese.
  retards.
  you done?
what do you want?
we're here
to take care o' the sangs.
okay. come inside.
c'mon.
this is who we think
you'd come for.
this is who we will die for.
first, they told us
there'd be good jobs, good money.
some went.
but nobody come back.
they come for more.
they say as soon as our men go to job,
the others come home.
my husband goes.
for a long time, we hear nothing.
then... the sangs come and
they take all of the rest of the men.
forced them to work in the mines.
same in the next village. and the next.
they take my sons.
now all that is left
are the very young.
and they will be back for them, too.
i know this.
we all know this.
so, we hide them and we wait.
  why don't you just move on? leave.
  this is our home.
our lives will be
the last thing they take.
  tell us why you're here now.
  we're trackin' 'em.
can't you stay... and help?
you saw the children!
soon they'll be done
and they kill them all.
we have
our own business with them.
i'm sorry. let's go.
i don't think
they're gonna last here much longer.
i think they know that.
so we're not gonna
do anything about it?
i got an idea.
and with your ego,
i think you're gonna love it.
  my ego?
  your ego.
  what do you mean, my ego?
  you got a big ego.
well, check your ego out.
please. your ego is like
the size of a dinosaur. huge.
we have it.
we found the plutonium.
by the power vested in me,
i now pronounce you...
man and knife.
one more!
rest in pieces.
  this is the last one?
  da.
good.
the chambers are cleared.
no loose ends.
you bury them all.
i see about a dozen guards...
light weapons...
a couple of badass .50 cals...
worse.
anti tank devices.
there's no way our trucks
will get through that mine field.
look,
i know this is a stupid question,
but you got any ideas
that won't get us killed?
i got a few
i'm thinkin' about.
  boom time?
  boom time.
target in sight!
  baby wants to travel!
  fire!
  rock and roll!
  fire!
bombs away!
tighten up!
  what's happening now?
  chaos!
  you're not doin' what i think you're doin'.
  yeah, i am.
let's do it!
come on, let's move!
you're gonna need a new plane.
  we're too late!
  what?
the plutonium's gone.
c'mon, c'mon, let's get outta here!
c'mon, c'mon!
go, go, go!
move it, move it, move it!
go, go, go!
go on, get outta here!
go, go, go, go!
pick it up! pick it up!
we're gonna be here awhile.
don't seem right.
  goin' out this chickenshit way?
  somethin' like that.
hey, it ain't over yet, kids.
i got a plan.
everybody calm down.
phosphate rock.
  what's he doin'?
  probably makin' a bomb.
you serious?
ask 'im.
  what you doin', gunner?
  i'm makin' a bomb. you mind?
  a maniac with brains.
  scary.
phosphate rock...
it's got a density of 1.852.
melting point, 44.2 centigrade.
guys... i want some gunpowder, fast.
do it. the man's
a chemical engineer, right?
and a fulbright scholar.
pour it in the pipe.
  the big man might be onto somethin'.
  you think?
probably not.
need some help with that?
let's go!
here. go blow yourself up.
lighter?
i want that back.
better get back!
this is gonna be loud!
get back!
okay. uhh... all right, let's go!
all right.
better turn around
unless you want your heads blown off.
you better cover your ear.
c'mon.
well, the phosphorus must have been damp.
yeah, right.
  or you suck.
  there's that.
don't cry, gunner.
you almost had an idea.
i'm back.
how you doin', trench?
  oh, i thank you. i thank you.
  you're welcome.
bojan!
hm.
  we're even now, right?
  right.
i'll be seein' you around, trench.
thanks a lot.
  relax. it's not over yet.
  what?
that's right.
  how ya doin', pal?
  i was doin' pretty good, church.
what are you doin' here?
  i heard there was a party in town.
  yeah, but it's my party.
  has he always been this selfish?
  always.
thanks.
you wanna
kick vilain's ass or not?
don't forget the little rascals!
move it.
move out!
take the rest of the nukes
to the hangar. now!
and get the plutonium
on the plane.
follow me.
we need to buy some time.
go, go!
i'm out!
hold 'em up!
go! go! move!
shit!
  fun, huh?
  yeah.
oh! there he is!
come on, vilain.
  let's go!
  yeah.
tear 'im apart!
i'm almost out. i'll be back.
you've been back enough.
i'll be back.
yippee ki yay.
who's next? rambo?
good bye.
let's go!
maggots!
start the engine!
get that thing in the air.
i want to make some money!
move!
trench! get in!
my shoe is bigger than this car.
shoot something!
come on.
start the helicopter.
we have a special guest coming.
let's go!
take care of him!
this way!
cannot beat a classic.
  barney!
  what are you doin' here?
i'm goin' in there alone.
don't follow me, no matter what,
do you understand?
  do you understand?
  yes.
that door opens up, and i don't come out,
and he does, you kill 'im.
let's make it more dramatic.
now, that's better.
  i'm out of bullets.
  that's your problem.
not really.
you wanna kill me like a man?
or you wanna kill me...
like a sheep?
nice knife.
so...
what's it going to be?
  man... or sheep?
  you wanna man up?
i'll man you up.
you must want to hurt me bad.
i'm not gonna hurt you.
i'm gonna take your life.
come.
over so soon?
i want my money's worth.
  come on, get up!
  comin' right up.
going back down.
taste good?
talking to me?
time to wrap this up.
ironic.
here we are, you and i.
and your knife.
you're going to die.
like him.
what was his name?
what did you call 'im?
what does it matter?
come on, vilain.
somebody's dyin'.
come on, vilain.
come on, vilain.
come on!
get up, vilain.
get... up.
now turn around.
turn around, sheep.
now what?
his name was billy.
you know how to carve a turkey?
  you win?
  i think so.
well, where's the proof?
heads up.
nice touch.
mm hm.
it is a nice touch.
  a little extreme. but nice.
  mm hm.
and as much as i hate to say this,
bam bam,
now that we got control of the plutonium,
that makes us even.
good.
so, maggie,
you'll be coming with us then?
when you're ready.
so, i just want...
wow.
they're okay,
just a little immature.
i don't have to go.
if you want me to stay, i'll stay.
and i did save the babysitter's life.
that you did do.
maybe i'm good luck for you.
but i could be bad luck for you,
and i can't allow that.
if you ever want help... call me,
or you're dead.
i'll do that.
what are you doin' here?
moving on.
you killed all my business.
i thought you were the lone wolf.
sometimes
it's fun to run with the pack.
sure, you got a point.
you take care, maggie.
oh, i almost forgot.
as a token of my gratitude,
my violent friend,
i got you and the little rascals
a ride home.
  behold.
  what?
consider it a gift.
that thing belongs in a museum.
we all do.
  hey! fun, right?
  yeah, fun.
take care.
beware, beware,
walk with care.
careful what you do.
or mumbo jumbo's gonna
hoo doo you.
mumbo jumbo's gonna hoo doo you.
boomlay, boomlay, boomlay, boom!
to billy!
  to billy.
  to billy.
rest in peace.
  man, i need a massage.
  don't look at me.
  hey.
  what?
  from one friend to another?
  what?
you really should learn
how to fight.

you are suffering, sonja...
but vengeance shall be yours.
vengeance on queen gedren...
who wanted you for herself.
your disgust was clear.
and so it was that gedren
ordered your family murdered...
your body violated by her soldiers.
but in your quest
for justice and vengeance...
you will need great strength...
for your sword arm must have no equal.
i give you that strength.
varna, where is the lord of hyrkania?
he has not come, highness.
he should be here
for the destruction of the talisman.
but we cannot delay.
we will proceed without him.
o god of the high gods...
behold the talisman with which
you created the world and all things.
o god of gods...
it has become too powerful for us...
and we must destroy it
before it destroys the world.
forgive us now
as we send it out of the light...
from which it draws its power...
into eternal darkness.
forgive us.
come on.
so this can make worlds...
or shatter them by storm and earthquake.
have it lifted out.
lift it out!
touch it.
so it is true. only women may touch it.
the cover.
take it out.
great queen,
what shall we do with the prisoners?
  no!
  no!
come.
horses.
the talisman's stolen.
must destroy the talisman.
we must find my sister. take me.
i know where she is. please.
magnificent.
you have nothing more to learn, sonja.
you are the master of the master.
never have i seen your equal.
you must learn to like men a little better.
they are not all evil.
we must judge by our own experience,
grand master.
i know.
but in life, all is not swordplay.
hatred of men in a lovely young woman...
it could be your downfall.
i don't hate all men, grand master.
that would have been music to my ears
come.
a great swordsman
must have a great sword.
choose.
a gift from the grand master.
sonja.
what is it, red sonja?
i'm looking for red sonja.
  i am sonja.
  your sister's dying.
i'll take you to her.
varna.
thank god.
i've lived long enough.
the talisman's stolen.
all the priests massacred.
  we fought...
  rest, varna. later we can talk.
there's no time. listen.
the talisman has terrible power...
which grows in the light.
in 13 days it could destroy the world...
by storm and earthquake.
you must destroy the talisman, sonja.
send it into darkness. swear that you will.
i swear.
who took it?
i don't know.
there was a woman with a gold mask.
soldiers.
where did they take it? north? south?
she's dead.
and the living have work to do.
her work, my work, is no concern of yours.
  who are you, anyway?
  my name is kalidor.
i befriended your sister, remember?
i'm a friend of yours, too.
i thank you for what you did for my sister.
you will be rewarded.
i'm no mercenary. nobody pays me.
if i think somebody owes me something,
i take it.
someone is using the talisman.
  what place is that?
  hablok. it's a great city.
where are you going?
hablok.
wait. i'll come with you.
why should you? it's no business of yours.
and neither am i.
you may be wrong on both counts.
i know you're a brave girl,
but danger is my trade.
then i'll learn it by myself.
don't make me angry, kalidor.
i don't need any man's help.
don't shake it, fool. hold it steady!
can you do nothing right?
still, you great idiot.
i'm trying, your highness.
clumsy oaf. stupid, dumb,
useless, selfish beast!
quickly, come. come to me.
don't give me orders, slave.
i'll have you hung by the heels.
anyway, it's too slippery.
do you want me to fall
in that boiling mud? you numskull.
i'll try to swing it around. now.
  hold still, boy.
  boy?
steady, your majesty. steady.
jump off. jump.
what about me?
get back here and stop playing the fool.
i hear and obey, master of the world.
i'm coming.
lucky for you that this person came along.
reward her, and tell her who i am.
his royal highness, the prince tarn,
great lord of hablok...
keeper of the spotless throne...
great elephant who fertilizes the world
with his...
i've told you not to say that.
do it again, and i'll have you impaled.
well, reward her, fool.
from the look of your kingdom, prince,
you need this more than i do.
did she address me?
what happened?
queen gedren attacked us
is what happened.
gedren? queen gedren?
that's right.
she knocked down half the city with her
new weapon and demanded our surrender.
my army ran away.
do they want to live forever?
i refused to surrender.
so she knocked down the other half.
falkon, since everyone is dead
or run away...
you shall escort me
to the mountains tomorrow.
i shall raise a new army...
and crush this upstart gedren underfoot.
where can i find her, this queen gedren?
in burkubane, the land of eternal night.
how do i get there?
there's a long scenic way, and there's
the short way through brytag's toll road.
i'll take brytag's toll road.
which way is that?
straight north from here.
you can't miss it.
but it's worth a try.
ask the woman
if she wishes to join my army.
we'll probably need a cook.
your highness is too kind,
but i travel alone.
dismiss the woman, falkon.
i shall dine in an hour.
may i give you a word of advice?
put him over your knee
and beat some manners into him.
you wouldn't happen to have a tablecloth,
would you?
brytag, come down and open the gate.
not so fast, redhead.
i'm up here
where i can get a better look at you.
i have no time to waste, brytag.
i have plenty. come up, i say.
  come here, wench.
  why should i?
because i am brytag. this is my land.
all that pass through pay me tribute.
  how much, brytag?
  who mentioned money?
tribute, i said.
the tender kind all women pay to brytag.
suppose i don't.
suppose, instead, i open up
that great fat belly of yours.
you hear that?
she's going to open up my great...
woman, i have fought 177 men.
only one survives, and he has got no legs.
you dare to mock at brytag?
that takes no daring.
but when i've killed you,
will your warriors let me go unharmed?
when you've killed me?
when this wench has killed me,
you will let her go unharmed, won't you?
aye.
see?
so, wench.
i'm gonna feed your eyes
to the birds, red hair.
i don't need eyes to find you.
i can smell you at a hundred paces.
i will tell the future in your entrails,
red woman.
i know my future. you have none.
hold on, sonja.
sonja, come on.
look out!
this way. follow me!
  get away. go!
  what about you?
i can hold them. go!
hurry! stop them!
release me, ruffian!
release me, i say!
  tell us where it is.
  i'll have your head for this!
don't be shy.
the gold, boy. where's the gold?
there is no gold, ruffian.
i tell you, i have no gold!
you have fine raiment, boy,
almost as resplendent as mine.
and you expect me to believe
you're penniless?
i'll have you know, villain,
i am prince tarn of hablok.
my subjects will see
to your punishment for this.
and a grievous punishment it will be,
impertinent oaf!
your subjects?
my kingdom is greater than yours.
and i have but four.
pull him!
  are you all right, your sovereign majesty?
  yes, clumsy oaf.
why did you leave him?
we needed food. i went hunting.
you could have taken him with you.
tell her, falkon,
that i don't care for hunting.
he doesn't care for hunting.
treasure to the vaults,
prisoners to the dungeons.
take the talisman back
to the chamber of lights.
very well, my queen.
perhaps fewer candles...
would be advisable, your majesty.
why?
the stronger the light, the greater
the power of the talisman grows.
i want more light here, not less.
but it is dangerously powerful already,
great queen.
  look what it did to hablok.
  yes. very satisfying.
but i want its full power
when we march against toktyl, ikol.
its full power.
  it will be beyond our control, majesty.
  majesty!
enemies are approaching
the outer empire.
it's the prince of hablok, your majesty...
with his army.
insects.
that girl.
so she escaped the fire. how fortunate.
ikol, i want her alive
without so much as a scratch on her skin.
shall i send out a small ambush party?
no.
we'll wait till they get a little closer.
burkubane, the land of perpetual night.
falkon, proclaim my arrival...
and the defiance of queen gedren.
sound your trumpet.
keep quiet...
at least till we find a way across.
princes do not sneak in
on their enemies like thieves.
you don't know
much about princes, do you?
you wait here with the horses.
i want to test this bridge first.
or whatever it is.
it looks safe enough.
we'll lead the horses across.
now hear me, gedren!
it is i, prince tarn of hablok...
to revenge myself
on the tyrant of burkubane.
be quiet, you arrogant, ungrateful pup.
how dare you, woman?
i'll show you how i dare.
this should have been done long ago.
no. if you must hit someone, then hit me.
you're not worth the effort, boy.
boy?
yes, boy. you'll never be anything else...
till you learn gratitude
and self sacrifice, like falkon.
he's a real man.
she didn't mean it, my prince.
she doesn't know your fine qualities.
take that, ruffian.
take that, you ruffian.
practicing, highness?
i thought princes did everything so well,
they wouldn't need to.
i was disarmed by those ruffians
the other day.
i noticed. so? it needn't be fatal.
i am disarmed. kill me. come on.
come on!
you're meant to be
using your sword. remember?
simple, isn't it?
but it's not in the rule book.
you see, fencing and fighting
are two different things.
you need to learn them both.
will you teach me to fence and to fight?
if you please?
spoken like a prince.
you were disarmed
because you hold the hilt too tight.
grip gently. see?
gently. i see. like this?
your highness learns fast.
i think we'll continue
your fencing lessons another time.
we've an early start.
you are very beautiful.
when i am king of hablok,
i shall have you at my court.
you will? my, the honor.
i may even make you my queen.
but i'm still young.
we shall have to see.
they will reach
the ithian cavern tomorrow.
we must force them to take shelter there.
the killing machine will do the rest.
yes. they'll make fine fish food.
but not the girl.
i want that beauty here with me.
see to it that she is spared.
i'll do my best, my queen.
the machine is difficult to control.
one cannot guarantee
that something will not go wrong.
if it does, you will be its next victim.
the talisman, ikol. we need a storm.
a little one.
we should be out in the storm.
why? this is shelter, isn't it?
i haven't got time to shelter.
i've four days left to find the talisman.
besides, something drove us in here...
every bit of the way.
i noticed it, but i'm not complaining.
where's tarn?
he promised not to wander.
dry off, i'll go find him.
look at this.
it must be the biggest in the world.
could be fake.
there's a lot of bad stuff around.
this pearl can rebuild hablok...
fill its treasury, buy me an army.
dig it out!
your highness,
it may belong to somebody.
it does, and he wants it now!
yeah.
use your dagger, fool!
what are you doing?
falkon, highness, look at the water!
come on. put your back into it.
it won't budge.
maybe it wasn't meant to come out.
the water is rising.
you must get out of here.
  this way! make for the stairs!
  come, my prince!
  get out of the water!
  yes.
climb up here, my prince.
tarn!
i'm coming, my prince!
let go!
where is she?
i can't kill it! it's a machine!
sonja, we have to blind it!
it's our only chance!
falkon, get out! it can't see!
there. keep it covered.
why have you been following me?
to see that you reach the talisman safely.
why?
i have to be sure
that the talisman is destroyed.
centuries ago, the high lords of arcadia...
had entrusted the talisman
to the priestesses...
because only women may touch it.
but to guard it,
or to destroy it if need be...
is still the duty of the high lord.
you? the high lord?
i was coming to the temple
to see the talisman destroyed...
when i found your sister dying...
and learnt that the talisman
had been stolen.
so she guided me to you.
why didn't you tell me who you were?
you didn't seem to want a man's help.
but you needed it,
so that's why i followed you.
i had to be sure you reached the talisman.
i see.
i misunderstood.
i thought you had another reason.
i did.
no. i'm under a vow.
no man may have me
unless he has beaten me in a fair fight.
so the only man that can have you
is one who has tried to kill you.
that's logic.
if you yield only to a conqueror,
then prepare to be conquered.
little sonja.
don't be a fool. i don't want to kill you.
try it.
come on.
keep it down over there.
we're trying to sleep.
are you all right?
yes, prince. we were just practicing.
then let me down!
thank you.
why does she fight so hard?
she doesn't want to win.
gedren's army.
another kingdom enslaved.
the talisman! we must find a way in.
we'll have to climb.
three of us should go in.
who'll stand guard this doorway,
the post of danger?
  falkon?
  me? here?
i don't know what's coming out that door.
no, i am going up.
coward!
i'll take my chances in there.
and i have to go in.
i'll stay.
take care, your highness.
thank you.
tomorrow, i start my diet.
majesty, the talisman
is almost beyond control.
we must bury it in the dark
before it is too late!
it'll be buried when i have no further use
for it, and that time is not yet.
but it will kill us all!
o god, majesty, what do you want?
our vaults are brimming with gold.
great states live in terror of us!
  what more is there?
  the world, ikol!
today we took another piece
of the city of toktyl.
but i have wider claims
and the talisman will enforce them!
madness. there will be no world.
there will be no world.
we must find the talisman.
only i can touch it, remember.
you take that way, i'll go the other way.
falkon, you take the center.
how's the food around here?
who are you?
  look for the talisman.
  yeah. right.
  ikol, gedren's black spider.
  you.
yes. prince tarn of hablok:
the city you blasted
with your filthy sorcery.
so the royal brat hasn't learnt his lesson.
out of my way, child.
so that you can desert,
like the thief you are?
with my gold?
hablok's gold?
now that was unmannerly
of your highness...
and rude little boys need correction...
if they're going to grow up into...
i'm afraid your highness' growth
is going to be stunted permanently.
now, yield, black spider.
where's queen gedren?
she's gone. i'm so glad that you've come.
please, will you protect me?
i'm so frightened.
gedren! where are you?
i'm dealing with the scoundrels in the cave!
so the prince of hablok
honors us with his presence unwisely.
how many are with you?
tell me! how many are with you?
  how many?
  enough, gedren!
get back, or hablok will need
an heir to the throne.
and your own throne, gedren.
unless the talisman goes into the dark,
your whole kingdom will...
prince, get kalidor and falkon.
there's a way behind the throne.
the talisman, gedren. quickly!
you are a fool.
we could have ruled the world together.
now i shall rule alone,
and you will die for what you did to me.
what i did?
you slaughtered my parents like cattle.
my brother, my sister!
vermin! what were their lives
compared to this?
you are mad!
the talisman will destroy you.
up here, sonja.
up here.
kalidor, falkon, this way! hurry!
down this hallway!
sonja. over here.
falkon, help.
prince tarn, come back.
i am here, gedren. death to all tyrants.
sonja, help me!
i'm trapped!
sonja! behind you!
i can't get through.
falkon, pull her through. i'll hold the gate.
follow me. this is the way out.
how do you know, highness?
because this is the way
i came in, you clown.
here's the way through.
go. quickly!
the door doesn't move.
how does it open?
i know. leave it to me.
no! come back, prince!
he's done it.
we can't leave him.
wait here, my prince. don't go away.
save yourselves! run for it!
you, too, falkon, you great, clumsy oaf!
run! run for it!
i'm not leaving here without you,
my prince.
give me your hand. reach. i'll get you out.
hablok is over there.
when it's rebuilt,
you must come to visit us.
i'm sure to need a queen someday.
you'll find one.
whoever she is, prince, choose carefully.
i make it a rule never to take a woman
unless she can beat me in a fair fight.
that's a challenge
i might think about someday.
what about right now?
why not?
come along, falkon.
come on.

thank you.
what a great celebration. thank you all for being here today.
you know, there are so many people that i want to thank. but i want to start first with my wife, maria.
i want to thank her.
i want to thank her for the love and the strength that she has given me. i want to thank her so much for being the greatest wife and the most spectacular partner. and i know how many votes i got today because of you. yes.
i also want to thank my parent in-laws, eunice and sargent shriver, right over here.
and also, all my brother-in-laws and extended family.
as a matter of fact, all the people behind me are the shrivers.
ok? so you know.
i want to thank them also for coming out here. i want to thank them all for coming out here from washington. i really appreciate their support.
and i want to thank also our children: katherine, christina, patrick and christopher. so much, yes.
i want to thank them for being so understanding, even though they asked me every day, when is this campaign going to be over?
that's what i tell them. it is over. so i really appreciate their understanding.
and i want to thank also all the people on this campaign. all the people that volunteered, the hard work they've put in there.
all of you people here.
i want to thank them for manning the phones, for stuffing the envelopes, for handing out the fliers, handing out the yard signs, handing out the bumper stickers, raising the money, the fantastic job they've done working around the clock, all of them on my behalf.
i wouldn't be standing up here today if it wouldn't be for you all.
i want to thank all the volunteers, all of you for the great work.
i want to also thank the people of california.
from the time i came over to this country, you've opened up your arms to me. you've received me. you've given me opportunities, endless amount of opportunities.
everything that i have is because of california. i came over -- that's right.
i came here with absolutely nothing. and california has given me absolutely everything.
and today, and today, california has given me the greatest gift of all. you've given me your trust by voting for me.
thank you very much to all the people of california for giving me their great trust.
and let me tell you something. i will do everything i can to live up to that trust. i will not fail you. i will not disappoint you. and i will not let you down.
for two months, i've been speaking out about the needs of bringing back fiscal responsibility to this state, bringing back the positive business atmosphere, bringing back businesses, bringing back jobs and bringing back our education.
it's very important that we need to bring back the trust in the government itself.
for two months, i went up and down the state and listened to the people.
i met good, honest and hard-working people. people that wanted to raise their families here. people who want to do business here, who want to have jobs here, who want to educate their kids here. people that want to enjoy the clean air and the clean water.
and i have heard your voice. i have heard your voices loud and clear.
we have tough choices ahead. the first choice that we must make is the one that will determine our success.
shall we rebuild our state together? or shall we fight amongst ourselves, to create even deeper division and fail the people of california?
well, let me tell you something, the answer is clear, for the people to win, politics as usual must lose.
i will reach out to republicans, to democrats and independents, to those who supported the recall and those who did not, those who supported me today and those who did not.
i want to reach out to everybody, to young and old, rich and poor, people of all religions, all colors and all nationalities.
i want to be the governor for the people. i want to represent everybody.
i just received a gracious phone call from governor davis.
i really appreciated that call, because he promised me that he will work hard to make this transition smooth, and i really appreciated that phone call. yes.
i believe very strongly that a smooth transition is very important for the people of california. and this is why i instructed my transition team to treat their counterparts with the utmost respect.
i will call tomorrow the leaders of the legislatures, both democrats and republicans, and i will let them know that my door will always be open, that i want to work with them together for the good of california.
and the same goes for the members of the legislatures. it doesn't matter if they're to the left or to the right or to the center. i extend my hands to them. i want to work with you. i need your help.
and to the other candidates for governor, i also extend to you the olive branch of political reconciliation, so that we can move california forward.
tonight, we are all here celebrating, and we all have reasons to celebrate.
but tomorrow, the hard work will begin. oh, yes.
and in closing, i want to say something to you that i've been saying for the last two months, traveling up and down the state.
i want to be the people's governor. i want to represent everybody. i believe in the people of california, and i know that together we can do great things.
i know that together we can make this again the greatest state of the greatest country in the world.
thank you very much. thank you. and god bless all of you. thank you.

mr. chief justice, governor and mrs. davis, governor and mrs. wilson, governor and mrs. deumejian, governor brown, legislative leadership, constitutional officers, my fellow californians.
i am humbled, i am moved and i am honored beyond words to be your governor.
to the thousands of you who came here today, i have taken the oath to serve you. to the others across this state, democrats, republicans, and independents, it doesn't matter, i took the oath to serve you. to those who have no power, to those who have dropped out, disappointed in politics as usual, i took the oath to serve you.
i say to everyone here today, and to all californians, i will not forget my oath, and i will not forget you.
let me first thank governor davis and mrs. davis, and the entire administration for a smooth transition. there has been a spirit of mutual respect in our cooperation, and i want to thank you for that. thank you very much. thank you. my fellow citizens, today is a new day in california.
i did not seek this office to do things the way things have been done. what i care about is to restoring your confidence in your government.
when i became a citizen 20 years ago, i had to take the citizenship test. i had to learn about the history and principles of our republic. and what i learned and what i have never forgotten is that sovereignty rests with the people -- not with the government.
in recent years, californians have lost confidence. they felt that the action of their government did not represent the will of the people.
this election was not about replacing one man. it was not about replacing one party. it was about changing the entire political climate of this state.
everywhere i went during my campaign, i could feel the public hunger for our elected officials to work together, to work openly and to work for the greater good. this election was the people's veto for politics as usual.
with the eyes of the world upon us, we did the dramatic. now we must put the rancor of the past behind us and do the extraordinary.
it is no secret that i'm a newcomer to politics. i realize i was elected on faith and hope. and i feel a great responsibility not to let the people down.
as soon as i go inside the capital behind me, i will sign my first order as governor. i will sign executive order no. 1, which will repeal the 300 percent increase in a car tax.
i will issue a proclamation convening a special session of the legislature to address california's fiscal crisis.
i will issue a proclamation convening a special session to reform our worker's compensation system.
i will call on the legislators to repeal sp-60.
and i will work hard to reform government, but bringing openness and full disclosure to public business.
i enter this office beholding to no one, except you, my fellow citizens.
i pledge my governorship to your interests, not to special interests.
so i have appointed to my cabinet the republicans, democrats, and independents because i want the people to know that my administration is not about politics, it is about saving california. the state of california is in a crisis. as i've said many times, we have spent ourselves into the largest deficit in the nation. we have the worst credit rating in the nation. we have the highest worker's compensation costs in the nation. and next year we will have the highest unemployment insurance costs in the nation. and we have the worst business climate in the nation.
but even though these problems are staggering, they do not even compare in what californians have overcome in the past. our state has endured earthquakes, floods and fires. the latest fires have destroyed lives, homes, businesses, and devastated [hundreds] of thousands of acres of land that we love.
on behalf of my fellow citizens, i salute all of those who have served on the front lines of the battle. the firefighters, emergency worker, law enforcement officials, national guards and the thousands of volunteers.
as we watched the fires storms raging, we saw bravery that never faltered and determination that never wavered in a fight that never flagged.
to the families of those who gave their lives and those who have lost the lives, your loss is ours. as californians, we mourn together. we fight together. and we will rebuild together.
and just as california will come back from the fires, we will also come back from fiscal adversity. i know there are some of you who say that the legislature and i will never agree on the solutions to their problems. but i have found in my life that people often respond in remarkable ways, to remarkable challenges.
in the words of president kennedy, i am an idealist without illusions. i know it will hard to put aside years of partisan bitterness, i know it will be hard overcome the political habits of the past. but for guidance, let's look back in history to a period that i started when i became a citizen.
the summer of 1787. delegates of the original 13 states were meeting in philadelphia. the dream of a new nation was falling apart. divisions were deep. events were spiraling downward. merchant against farmer, big states against small, north against south.
our founding fathers knew that the fate of the union is in their hands. just as the fate of our california is in our hands. what happened in that summer of 1787 is that they put their differences aside and produced the blueprint for our government, our constitution.
they are coming together, has been called the miracle of philadelphia. now the members of the legislature and i must bring about the miracle of sacramento. a miracle based on cooperation, good will, new ideas and devotion to the long-term good of california.
what we face may look insurmountable. but i learned something in all these years of training and competing. i learned something from all of these years of lifting and training hard. i thought i couldn't lift another ounce of weight. what i learned was that we are always stronger than we know.
and california is like that, too. we are stronger than we know.
there is a massive weight we must lift off our state. alone, i cannot lift it. but together, we can.
it is true that things may get harder before they get better. but i have never been afraid of the struggle. i have never been afraid of the fight. and i have never been afraid of the hard work.
i will not rest until our fiscal house is in order. i will not rest until california has a competitive job creating machine. i will not rest until the people of california come to see their government as a partner in their lives, and not a roadblock to their dreams.
today i ask all of you to join me in a new partnership for california. one that is civil and respectful of our diverse population. one that challenges each and every one of us to serve our state in a joyful, productive and creative way.
ladies and gentlemen, i have an immigrant's optimism, that what i have learned in citizenship class is true, the system does work, and i believe that with all my heart.
i have big hopes for california. president reagan spoke of america as the shining city on a hill. i see california as the golden dream by the sea.
perhaps some think that this is fanciful and poetic, but to an immigrant like me, who as a boy saw the soviet tanks rolling through the streets of austria, to someone like me who came here with absolutely nothing and gained absolutely everything, it is not fanciful to see california as the golden dream.
for millions of people around the world, california has always glimmered with hope and glowed with opportunity. millions of people around the world sent their dreams to california, with the hope that their lives will follow.
my fellow citizens, i have taken the oath to uphold the constitution of california. and now, with your help, and with god's, i will also uphold the dream that is california. thank you very much. and may god bless california. thank you very much. thank you.

far in the dim past. . .
when myth and history
merged into mystery
and the gods of fable
and the primitive beliefs of man
dwelt on ancient
mount olympus,
in antique greece
a legendary hero walked
godlike upon the earth. . .
sometimes.
man: why can't i go?
because your place
is here with the rest of us.
  you let mars travel.
  that's his job.
u ntil mankind learns to dispense
with his services
and lives in peace,
mars must go where he's called.
i only want
to browse around.
you'd only get into trouble.
i have been here
thousands of years.
  i am bored.
  don't interrupt your father!
besides. . .
these mortals are
bedeviled by
as aggravating a collection
of annoyances
as it is possible for one
to imagine.
it may not be entirely
without merit,
  but you wouldn't like it there.
  let me be the judge of that.
i am tired of the same old faces,
the same old things.
tired or not,
you're staying here!
woman: zeus, i beg of you,
hercules is only hotheaded.
he does not mean to oppose
your wishes.
mind your own business,
venus.
he has grown insufferable.
i will not be bearded to my face
by this insolent young whelp.
he's only a demigod.
he gives himself airs
his mortal birth does not warrant.
my mother may have been a mortal,
but you, zeus, my father,
are a god.
i will discuss this
no further.
does this mean i have
zeus' permission to leave?
it means you will stay.
i don't wish to hear
another word on the subject.
i won't stay.
you are trying my patience,
hercules.
  you are trying mine.
  heed my words!
nobody will stop me.
how dare you address
such remarks to your father!
it's easy.
why you offensive puppy!
perhaps this will teach you
respect for your elders!
venus: zeus,
hercules is half mortal.
  he may be killed.
  he's only a spoiled youth.
save him.
hercules is your son.
forgive him!
if i had known how much trouble
it would cause me,
i'd have thought twice when i met
his mother on vacation.
aahh!
  tell me what's wrong.
  i just saw a man.
yes, my dear, that's not unusual.
there are men on this airplane.
no, outside!
  he was flying.
  outside?
yes, he just passed my window.
stewardess!
and he was. . .
he was naked!
and he was just going down,
flying.
  and he. . .
  we're traveling at 30,000 feet.
no man,
nude or otherwise,
could possibly be flying
outside a jet plane.
oh, he was very handsome.
and he had big muscles.
and he was practically naked.
oh, dear.
oh, my.
i shouldn't have taken agatha
to see all those greek statues.
she's so impressionable.
we throw ourselves
at zeus' feet.
woman: get up,
you stupid creatures.
let hercules suffer the consequences
of his own obstinacy.
juno has hated hercules
ever since the day of his birth.
all right! do not be
disrespectful to my wife.
let us see what
he is doing now.
he's in the sea now.
he will drown!
save him, great zeus.
it will take more than neptune
or any of his creatures
  to overcome a son of zeus.
  save him, zeus!
save hercules!
all right, all right.
i have done so.
behold, coming over
the horizon of the sea.
what were you doing
out in the water?
  swimming.
  a hundred miles from land?
i fell.
  fell?
  yes.
how did that happen?
  there was an explosion.
  oh?
  what ship?
  ship?
from which you
were blown overboard.
olympus.
there's a greek freighter
by that name.
  what's your name?
  hercules.
  greek, huh?
  very old family.
sir?
it's all right,
i'm democratic.
you're addressing the captain
of this ship. say ''sir'' to me.
  i am hercules.
  so you told me.
no man is superior
to hercules.
begging the captain's
pardon,
but an immersion in the water
can put a man off his head.
h uh.
  what's your berth?
  i am the son of zeus.
i'm referring to your rating,
not your family tree.
what's your rating
when you ship out to sea?
what's your second name?
hercules what?
as i have told you,
i am hercules, son of zeus.
i don't think he means
any disrespect.
he probably loses it
in the translation.
all right, sign him on
as hercules zeus,
since that's his father name,
and get him an o.s. rating.
aye, aye, sir.
get him what clothes
you can that might fit him.
come with me.
  where's this ship bound for?
  new york.
carstairs!
carstairs!
stop that fight!
okay, i'm with you, boy.
better forget it.
oh no, you don't. no, no.
i'm your friend.
bosun,
what's the meaning of this?
well, he refused to work, sir.
and when i tried
to persuade him, well, he. . .
he's a foreigner.
perhaps he didn't
understand you.
i understood him.
he's most disagreeable
and he has irritated me.
  where do you think you're going?
  ashore.
  the captain give you permission?
  hercules goes where he wishes.
not on this ship, you don't.
get your carcass below.
get yours!
yo, hercules!
come back here!
stop him!
somebody grab him!
get him!
alex!
hey, you guys!
that flattens him.
man: come on! come on!
oooh!
come on, push him.
that's it.
come on!
come on, push it!
come on, let's get him!
you'd better get out of here.
they're gonna kill you!
come on,
we'll get a cab.
here!
go ahead!
what's the matter with you?!
let go!
fine chariot,
but where are the horses?
let go of that!
what's the matter?
hey, let go of that!
where to?
uptown.
and step on it!
boy, that was close.
what was close?
they almost nailed you!
what did you do?
jump ship?
no, i walked off.
you walked off.
  what's your name?
  hercules.
oh. mine is pretzi.
they call me pretzi,
because, you see,
i sell pretzels
on the waterfront.
  where you from?
  greece.
oh! i used to know
a greek guy.
he ran a beanery
down in the village.
his name was apollo.
i never found out
what his second name was.
  i know apollo.
  you do?
well, is this a small world?
you know apollo. gee.
i wonder where apollo is now.
i haven't seen him
in two or three years.
  he's back home.
  he went home, huh?
he was all the time talking about
how homesick he was.
so he finally went home.
he was a real nice guy.
conceited. he thinks there's
nobody handsomer in the world.
handsome? apollo?
you must be kidding.
come on, say you're kidding.
handsome? with that big black
wart on his nose?
and those
little beady crossed eyes?
he must have been in disguise.
i wonder if apollo
ever got married.
he was all the time
looking for a wife.
maybe that's why he went home,
to find a wife.
diana and terpsichore
are in love with him.
i think hebe is attracted, too.
no kidding.
it shows you how desperate
some women could be.
that is really amazing.
you hungry?
wait a minute.
here, here.
go ahead, help yourself.
  i'm grateful.
  think nothing of it.
good, huh?
food for the gods.
well, i get them
from a bakery in brooklyn
called
''food for the gods bakery.''
where you guys wanna go?
hey, what do you know?
central park.
this is good enough.
it's fine.
here we are
in central park.
i'll go get my bag.
  that'll be two bucks.
  big city, new york.
bigger than athens.
bigger than rome.
bigger than carthage.
i'd say new york is the biggest
place there is.
  pay the cabbie.
  pay him?
  what?
  for the ride, two bucks.
bucks?
the bread, the shekels,
you know, the long green,
the money, two bucks!
he wants to be paid for driving
hercules in the chariot?
that's the idea, mack.
my name is hercules.
hercules, schmurcules,
give me the dough.
bucks? doe? what's all this talk
about male and female animals?
this guy got all his marbles?
he's just come over
from the old country.
look, herc, it's money.
you know, drachmas.
money?
i don't have any money.
you don't have any money?
holy moley.
he ain't got no money.
hercules doesn't need
any money.
what?
that's the stupidest thing
i've heard in my whole life.
a couple of deadbeats, huh?
pretzi: look, buddy,
you see. . .
there's been a little mistake.
well, now,
ain't that something.
a mistake.
well, what do you know. . .
a mistake.
last time, you gonna give up
the dough or ain't you?
isn't it enough since hercules
rode in your chariot?
you've been immortalized.
i've been who?
you heard him,
you've been immortalized.
  driver: are you nuts?
  well, you see. . .
  it's like this  
  driver: like what?
well, you see. . .
uh, we, i  
okay, call the cops.
not before i have some fun
by taking it out of your hides.
  run, herc!
  you deadbeat!
how dare you
touch hercules?!
brad says we've got the best
all around team we've ever had,
a cinch to win first place
in the intercollegiate meet.
i should hope so.
i know rod, for one,
has worked very hard,
even to the point
of neglecting you, i'm afraid.
i don't mind, dad.
i want him to succeed.
i'm sure he will,
darling.
you know what pleases me most,
helen, about these boys?
judging from their classroom work,
they apparently have brains
as well as brawn.
how are those men
over there?
they're just athletes
training.
  athletes?
  college guys.
hmmph. . .
what do you mean?
you think you could do better?
what do you mean?
these guys happen to be champions.
ha!
  nobody can beat them.
  ha!
wait!
where are you going?
  over there.
  what for?
to show them how
to throw the discus.
no, no.
you've gotta stay here.
you can't go
buttin' in there.
they would not like me
to instruct them?
no, it's just for college guys.
no outsiders allowed.
i am hercules.
put that discus down!
you have no business out here.
those men do not throw it
far enough.
  you don't say.
  i do say.
  what is it, helen?
  that man with the discus,
the coach seems to be
arguing with him.
these boys are
record holders.
then they should
be better.
i suppose you believe
that you're better.
i once showed them in the
olympics in greece how to do it.
they profited by
my instruction.
you showed us in
the greek olympics, huh?
  what year was that?
  that was the year. . .
hey, coach.
let him show us, coach.
maybe there is something
we could learn.
well,
it's always possible.
all right, go ahead.
show us.
thank you.
what else do you do?
i ncredible.
okay, tom.
great throw, tom!
great throw!
okay, let's see you
beat that.
a very good throw
for the earthbound.
skip the wisecracks.
put your money where your mouth is.
i do not have any money.
i mean, stop talking. . .
demonstrate.
all right.
wow.
that's my buddy.
he's a greek fella.
he just come over. . .
from greece.
  dawson.
  coach.
you're our anchorman here.
  show this fella something.
  yes, sir, coach.
fifty bucks says my pal beats
that guy about to jump now.
i'll take that.
it's a bet.
  this fella can hold the money.
  no, that's all right.
i trust ya, buddy.
all right, mister.
let's see you top that.
certainly,
if you wish me to.
wish you?
brother, i'm begging you.
  i beg your pardon?
  why, what's the matter?
  did i do something wrong?
  my name is professor camden.
  how do you do?
  and this is my daughter, helen.
here's our card.
i wonder if you'd
do me a favor.
sure, spill it.
have tea
with my daughter and me.
shh! not so loud!
you never know when one of them
narcotics cops is around.
tea, the conventional
social drink.
you mean the drinking stuff?
of course! what else?
wait a minute.
you want to get together
just to drink tea?
do you find that
so uncommon?
well, no, but eh. . .
it's just that nobody's ever invited
me to do that with them before.
well, around 4:00, then.
hm?
great.
and bring your friend along.
hey, herc!
please go into the library.
i'll tell the professor
you're here.
hercules: ha, ha.
pan.
it's a funny one.
i must tell him about this.
yeah, you must do that.
yeah.
helen: hello!
how do you do?
how do you do?
i'm so happy you both
could be here.
hey, cut that out!
  won't you be seated?
  thank you.
my father should be here
any minute.
  is anything wrong?
  what could be wrong?
it's just that you're looking
at me so strangely
i feel my hair may be out of place
or something of the sort.
everything's perfect.
everything's in its place.
  you remind me of someone.
  really? someone you know?
  a goddess.
  a goddess?
i remind you of a goddess?
it's a beautiful day,
isn't it?
if the sun comes out,
it will be a beautiful day.
you and she do have
a lot in common.
it's kind of you to be
so complimentary, but. . .
i must say it's the first time
anyone's been quite so. . .
so extravagant with his comparisons
where i'm concerned.
excuse me,
that must be my other guest.
what's the matter with you?
now you cut that out!
talking that way to that dame.
you're acting like some kind
of a bull in a ten cent store.
you just got here,
and right away you're on the make.
  what am i making?
  just cut it out.
that's no way to talk
to a dame.
i don't understand.
maybe i'm being
a little rough on you.
maybe you do things differently
where you come from,
but that's not the way we talk
to a dame here, that's all.
what did i say
that was wrong?
just cut it out!
that's all!
that's not the way to talk
to a broad, understand?
i guess you all
know each other.
  hi, fellas.
  how do you do?
how are you doing?
  hey, what's happening?
  is he your lover?
my what?
hey, mister,
watch your talk!
i can hear my talk.
i cannot watch it.
you won't hear it much longer
if you don't apologize to her.
apologize for paying
her a tribute?
a tribute?
  insulting her.
  a beautiful woman
with a handsome man for a friend,
they must be lovers.
herc, you cool it!
i find it unnatural
if they're not.
all right,
you asked for it!
ughh!
you have struck hercules.
come off that rap. keep that up,
and you'll have to be taken away.
what kind of chicken fat
you got in your head?
i am hercules.
you're hercules, i'm rod nelson.
now what? outside?
i can do it just as well
in here.
no, no.
you. . . you put him down!
  helen: really, you're crazy!
  herc!
will you put him down!
please, mr. hercules.
please put him down.
his first name is hercules.
his last name is zeus.
it rhymes with ''booze.''
i don't care what his name is.
tell him to put mr. nelson down.
herc, you heard
what the lady said.
put the guy down.
what's the matter with you?
pretzi: put him down
on his feet!
put him down!
turn him loose!
helen: put him down!
  put him down!
  tea is served.
well, i knew it.
doesn't surprise me a bit.
wherever he goes  
trouble.
what am i gonna do
with the young fool?
amusing situation with that fellow,
hercules, wasn't it?
amusing?
that man must be crazy!
  original.
  primitive.
  i find him refreshing.
  you must be kidding!
no.
he almost killed rod nelson.
he had to have some ribs taped.
nevertheless,
mr. zeus interests me.
i'd like to get to know him better.
study him more closely.
  oh, really?
  absolutely.
he had the effrontery to ask if
i'd have dinner with him tonight.
well, of course you told him. . .
  i would.
  naturally.
oh, it was a
wonderful evening.
  thank you so much
  i enjoyed it, too.
are you homesick?
i'm having too much fun.
what's it like back there,
where you come from?
didn't you tell me athens?
a seaport?
  we have a fine ocean view.
  oh, that's nice.
have any brothers
and sisters there?
lots, half brothers
and half sisters.
what does your father do?
what business is he in?
ha! he's a deity.
i suppose he must miss you.
he didn't want
to see me leave.
i n fact, he was most upset.
of course.
but a young man must see
the world, so they say.
this is what i told him.
do you have a girl
back home?
you know how it is.
no, i don't.
radio: all central park units.
all central park units.
escaped from zoo,
one 600 lb. grizzly bear.
take caution with animal,
known to be surly and dangerous.
i would really like
to see greece one day.
i've heard
it's a beautiful country.
perhaps you will
see it one day.
will you
show me around?
you like
to climb mountains?
well,
i've never done any, um. . .
have you ever been
on mt. olympus?
  i know it very well.
  no kidding!
i'm not kidding.
when i was a little girl,
i used to read all about it,
and the gods and goddesses who
were supposed to live on top of it,
and i believed it!
it's one of the joys
of being really young.
ooh!
ooh!
aaahh!
hercules!
beat him up!
aaahh!
oh, hercules!
ooh!
well, beat him!
  wrestling?
  we gotta get money somehow.
using our muscles is one
of the few ways i could think of
for us to get some dough.
u nless you've got a better idea
on how we're gonna pay the bills
that you've been running up
here at the hotel?
yes, sir, gents. . .
the wrassling game is. . .
lucrative.
mr. dugan promotes the wrestling
matches at the armory.
right.
  he saw your picture in the paper.
  right.
he read about what you'd done
to that bear.
and he brought us a proposition.
i'm your new partner.
i saw your boy hercules
wrestle last night.
and he's gonna go places.
yeah.
dugan tells me
you're easy to deal with.
and i hope so,
because here's my contract
to replace yours.
all you gotta do is
sign your name. . .
and here's the dough.
i don't have any contracts
with hercules.
he's my buddy. . .
we just got each others' word.
it makes it all the easier.
cuts the red tape.
sign your name.
fat lips, nitro and me
will take care of everything.
yeah.
no.
i ain't gonna do that.
hercules is my friend.
i ain't gonna sell him to nobody.
not to you, or him,
or him!
look, that boy of yours
is a comer.
with my connections,
that boy's gonna be
world champ in no time.
what's a little runt like you
gonna do for him,
except stand in his way?
and that don't fit in with my plans.
yeah.
no,
i ain't gonna do it.
now, look. . .
i'd like to do everything
nice and easy and legal.
but if you wanna get tough,
we can oblige you,
can't we, fellas?
yeah.
tell your boy
i'll be seeing him.
''hercules. . .
half god, half man,
was the son of jupiter,
or zeus  
as he was known
to the greeks  
and a mortal mother
named alcmene.
as juno,
zeus' wife,
was always hostile to
the offspring of her husband,
by mortal mothers,
she declared war against
hercules from his birth.
she sent two serpents
to destroy him
as he lay in his cradle.
but hercules strangled them
with his hands.''
holy moley!
i would speak with nemesis.
my son, hercules,
who has set himself against me. . .
is out in the world bringing
disrepute to his name.
he has no business there.
and where he is
is no place for him.
i hear, great zeus.
i charge you with a mission,
as she who is the avenger
of my displeasures.
i n all things, i obey.
go down to that continent
known as north america,
to that city
known as new york.
take with you my wish
that hercules be punished
for setting himself against me,
for demeaning that part
of him which is divine
in rioting among the mortals
of that benighted place.
great zeus,
i beg you, hold your anger
against hercules.
he means no harm.
he is simple,
and a bit childish.
give him a chance.
send me down there first
to persuade him to come back to us,
before you give nemesis
her task.
  yes, o zeus.
  heed mercury's plea.
send mercury for hercules
before you charge that dread
nemesis with her mission.
venus also adds her voice
in asking zeus to be patient
and merciful.
i don't wish to be
unduly harsh.
but hercules has been trying
my patience for centuries.
woman: yet be indulgent,
great zeus.
send mercury
to bring back hercules.
  give him this chance.
  let him stay down there.
he's been an annoyance
from his cradle on.
we all know why
you don't like hercules.
but surely, great zeus will not let
his judgement be affected
  by juno's malice.
  malice!?
  how dare you?
  all right. . .
i don't want any arguments.
so be it.
  mercury. . .
  great zeus.
tell hercules it is
my wish
he return to olympus
without delay.
do not fail.
  now be gone.
  as great zeus commands.
is it wise, o zeus,
to do this thing?
if hercules no longer finds
olympus to his taste,
then let him stay
where he is.
those down there will punish him
more than you ever would.
they resent one who is different
from themselves.
they will always try to
destroy him because of it.
it is the habit
with these unhappy mortals.
hercules is my son,
not yours.
i know you hate him, juno,
but we do not punish
in hate,
only in sorrow.
i have spoken.
oh look, you're famous.
that is not hercules.
and who is that monster
who looks as if he came from
the kingdom of the underworld?
oh, no.
this is a motion picture,
a play.
you mustn't take yourself
so seriously.
he doesn't even look like me.
look.
what are you doing?
oh, wow!
does he?
listen. . .
i really. . .
  does he?
  i wish you'd put your shirt on.
it isn't supposed
to look like anyone
except the actor
who plays the part!
what is the name
of that imitator?
who gave him permission
to pretend to be hercules?
listen.
stop joking.
i think. . .
i think we ought to go.
i nsolence.
hercules: what is that?
it's atlas
holding up the world.
according to greek mythology,
he was the one who. . .
atlas?
  yeah.
  poor likeness.
you have the oddest
sense of humor.
half the time i don't know
whether you're joking or not.
did your mother drop you
on your head as a baby?
what happened?
once i strangled two serpents
in the cradle.
oh. . .
come along.
i'll show you more of our city.
first, let's take a picture
of atlas.
okay.
and now of you.
smile.
this fine food for only
a few small coins?
they who run this place must be
public benefactors.
let's go and get a table.
very pretty.
i like new york very much.
i'm glad.
perhaps you'll stay here longer
than you thought you might.
well,
another hundred years,
at least.
  greetings, hercules.
  mercury.
  what brings you down here?
  you.
  zeus, he sent you?
  i am here at his command.
why?
to ask you in zeus' name
to return to olympus with me.
i don't wish to return yet.
zeus insists on it.
i like it down here.
do not defy zeus.
you can only suffer by it.
he's all the time
nagging me.
mercury: it is out of the love
he bears you.
when did you see
my father last?
about five minutes ago.
how did you leave things
in olympus?
about the same.
everybody misses you.
hercules: juno, too?
well, you know juno
and her jealousy
of every woman
zeus looks twice at.
venus especially asked me
to give you her best wishes.
tell zeus i'll come back
when i'm ready.
i wouldn't want to do that.
you know how handy he is
in throwing those thunderbolts
when he's angry.
i'm not worried about
zeus' thunderbolts down here.
zeus has another instrument
to punish those who offend him. . .
nemesis.
he wouldn't send her
after me.
it was only at the solicitation
of your friends
that he sent me in her place
to make this plea for your return.
why can't the old man
let me alone?
for the first time
in 2,000 years
i'm enjoying myself
and he's trying to spoil it.
this is no place for you.
everything is changing.
mortal man has no more belief
in the old ways.
i'm enjoying myself,
just the same.
  you are living a fallacy.
  it doesn't hurt me.
such overconfidence
could be ruinous.
i'm going
to take a shower.
please, hercules,
come back to olympus.
now you're reasonable,
mercury.
and you're also
my half brother.
what harm am i doing
down here?
  you could do great harm.
  harm to whom?
  yourself.
  what are you talking about?
hercules can only be
hercules.
you are confusing these mortals
with your behavior.
hercules: ha!
i know a theater
on the street named
broadway.
there's a man
who plays me so well.
they shower money on him.
it proves they know me.
i must get back to olympus.
i cannot delay.
zeus would hold it against me.
are you coming back or not?
no.
is that the message you would
have me deliver to zeus?
i will come sometime,
but not right now.
then i fear for you,
hercules.
such obstinacy can have
only grave consequences.
give my regards to venus.
right.
she will be distressed to know
that you are defying your father.
i'm not defying him. i just want
to stay here for a while.
farewell, then.
i carry your words back
to olympus with a heavy heart.
if you will not take
my advice,
then heed my caution:
beware of nemesis.
goodbye, my half brother.
i'm sure he meant well.
but, but. . .
he. . .
ooohh!
helen: you know what
i think?
i think he's slightly
demented.
either that, or he's the world's
most dedicated joker.
perhaps he's suffering
from delusions of grandeur.
his name is hercules,
so he thinks he's hercules.
what's so terrible about that?
we've heard of people
who think they're napoleon.
u h huh.
but they're in institutions.
the young man's aberration
may be a mild megalomania.
i don't care.
i like him.
even if he is a bit crazy.
so do i , even if he did
crack two of my ribs.
a greek peasant with delusions
of mythological divinity.
fascinating.
open it up. . .
i've seen it, i've seen it.
he opens up. . .
i seen it!
i seen it!
  i seen it.
  pretzi, how are you?
i seen it.
i seen it.
he. . . he. . .
he flung himself
right out the window  
head first  
from the 23rd floor!
and then he fell straight up!
what are you talking about,
pretzi?
i seen it
with my own eyes.
what did you see, pretzi?
he called him, ''mercury.''
they were talking
about his old man.
seems he come over here
to get him to come home.
but he don't wanna come home,
so mercury throws himself
out the window,
straight up into the sky!
take it easy, pretzi.
  get him a drink, helen.
  no, please, no.
no booze, no.
i think that's what did it.
i don't know. i seen it. . .
clear as daylight.
  a cup of coffee may help.
  right, i'll get it.
now, pretzi, i presume
you are talking about hercules.
yeah, hercules.
right.
did you have anything
to drink?
well, i . . .
i might have had a couple
of snorts.
and how much is a couple?
a pint.
a pint?
well. . .
a fifth.
relax. a cup of black coffee,
and everything will be fine.
holy moley!
i tell ya. . .
i've never seen anything
like this before in my whole life.
that was the answer hercules
gave you to bring to me?
it was not so insolent
as zeus imagines.
i n fact, hercules spoke of you
with affection.
  yet he defied my command.
  but not in so many words.
he said he would come back,
but not just yet.
he dares to temporize with me!
i'll blast him!
nemesis. . .
come here!
nemesis. . .
can i talk with you
a moment, nemesis?
make it brief, o wife to zeus.
i am on a mission.
what punishment did my
husband decree for hercules?
it is for him to tell you,
not i .
it is for you to tell me
when i ask!
am i not wife to zeus?
i order you!
i am to convey hercules to
the underworld kingdom of pluto
where he is to remain
for a hundred years.
what kind of a punishment
is that?
hercules will have
the time of his life
roistering about
with that lecher.
pluto is the king
of all evil pleasures.
if it is zeus' thought that
hercules should reside in hell. . .
i have a keener one for him.
let him stay where he is.
but earth is where
hercules wishes to be.
yes. . .
but as hercules.
  i don't understand.
  with all his great strength,
it sets him apart
from other mortals.
they might even make
him king because of it.
they have no kings
where hercules is.
they're called ''presidents.''
a king by any other name,
in his heart still thinks
of himself as king.
juno delays me.
i must leave.
what does she have in mind?
hercules' divinity.
his divinity?
since he seems to like it so well
where he presently is,
i shall give him a taste
of what it truly means.
he shall become one of
those wretched mortals
he finds it so fascinating
to be among.
but hercules is a demigod.
thanks to my husband's
philanderings.
i can't take away hercules'
divinity permanently. . .
but i can make him
as other men for a while. . .
as long as the effects from
the powder in this ring last.
hope for the best.
open the face of this ring.
pour the powder within
into hercules' drink.
then he will become
as other men,
no better,
and as vulnerable
as any of them.
it could mean that
hercules could. . .
  yes.
  he could get killed.
it might.
juno, i dare not.
i cannot take part
in undermining. . .
the will of the gods.
do my bidding. . .
or when i have zeus
here in private
i might tell him
a few things about you.
and one more thing. . .
on your way back,
make a little detour.
go see pluto.
i have a message for him.
pluto: forgive the barking.
it's only cerberus.
nemesis: seems to have
quite an argument.
he does that sometimes
when he's angry at himself.
it's those three heads,
you know.
how have you been,
pluto?
pretty nifty, except it's been
a hell of a day.
a new shipload.
ha! look who's here.
i'd ask you in,
but it's a mess.
thanks, but i wouldn't
have time for just a visit.
you say that hercules
is the same as
all those foolish mortals
he finds himself among?
temporarily.
zeus has decreed
that hercules should spend
the next hundred years
down here.
there has been an argument
between the two of them.
and so juno, um. . .
wants you to have the opportunity
to make the most of this.
what a triumph! what a coup!
what a feather in my cap!
to snatch the soul
of a demigod!
  when can i expect hercules?
  that's the problem.
he refuses to obey zeus.
then he won't come.
drat!
not voluntarily.
he must bring him
involuntarily.
and juno has. . .
facilitated matters.
surely juno realizes
that i am no murderer.
  i only punish.
  she understands that,
of course.
but she also knows
that you are ingenious.
and what she can't
accomplish by one means,
she is sure that you are
likely to achieve by another.
you know, that is true.
i always thought of myself
as a god of ideas.
then i'll leave the matter
in your hands.
goodbye.
goodbye.
pluto: i didn't mind climbing
all those stairs to get here,
but heights make me dizzy.
i'm not accustomed
to the altitude.
have you decided?
i don't care what zeus
has decreed.
i'm not coming with you.
  some other century, perhaps?
  it'll be safer for you.
safer? hercules is a god,
and safe wherever he goes.
things can change.
you're being ridiculous.
just listen to me for a minute.
you'll enjoy yourself.
you'll have a hell of a time.
i don't know what the occasion was
that prompted this influx of. . .
beautiful women. . .
  go away.
  you bother me.
  just listen.
i n this briefcase
i happen to have a contract
that was drawn up by the best
legal minds in the world,
who at the moment are involuntarily
the recipients of my hospitality.
what is it to me?
i mean if you play
your cards right
i can see that you can get
any one of those dames, women,
who might tickle your,
eh, fancy.
so just sign
on the dotted line,
and i'll take care of
everything else.
why don't you
go back to hell!
you've been away
too long already.
who is taking care of things?
who is feeding cerberus?
how did you get here?
you always shun the light.
nosy parker.
did you notice how dark it was?
  so this is your doing?
  um hmm.
how about signing
on the dotted line?
no. if you don't stop
annoying me, i . . .
listen, i'm not. . .
i'm not afraid of you.
hey, that's terrific,
but i'm also a god.
  i can try.
  you can try? listen.
i'll see you later.
we'll be in touch.
you're gonna. . .
hear from me.
i'll see you again sometime. . .
when you're run down.
said on the phone
he'd meet us here.
said we'd recognize him
by the briefcase he'd be carrying.
here he comes.
you weren't kidding about what
you said on the phone, were ya?
certainly not.
sure you'll be able
to handle it?
man: twenty thousand dollars?
okay, pal, it's a bet.
you're laying 20 grand
at 5 to 1
on hercules to lose?
the money.
what's your name?
where do you hang out?
where can i reach you?
don't worry about that.
all in good time.
we shall meet again.
mmmmm. . .
be assured of that.
well, goodbye. . .
for the present.
till next time.
i don't like
that guy's looks.
he gives me the creeps.
he's dangerous.
i wouldn't welsh on him
if i was you.
what's to welsh?
hercules is a cinch to win,
right?
if you say so.
he'll walk into a room
he won't walk out of
if he don't come through
for me.
twenty grand, huh?
that's a lot of dough.
figure this guy knows
something we don't know?
what could he know?
he's a long shot plunger!
  disturbing you?
  no, dear, come in.
did you see
today's newspaper?
not yet.
anything of special interest?
an item
in wesley watkins' column.
listen. . .
''new yorkers are talking
about the claim
of champion wrestling contender,
hercules the great
that he's the strongest man
in the world.''
i wouldn't be inclined
to dispute that.
someone does. listen.
''foremost among those
to dispute this statement
is circus strongman,
monstro the magnificent.
he declares himself
as willing to put up
$1 0,000 on the outcome
of a weightlifting contest.''
there's a man with
his work cut out for him.
''broadway scuttlebutt has it
that the matter
may be settled
on a national variety
television program.''
i personally have no doubt
as to the outcome.
hi!
came to wish you luck.
thank you.
father's out front
rooting for you, too.
i'm glad for it.
man: how's it going, pal?
  greetings.
  all set for the big match?
  it doesn't bother me.
  you'll take him, all right.
  what can stop me?
  glad to hear you say that.
i got a lot of dough spread out
on those muscles of yours.
  don't worry.
  i'm not worrying.
just reminding you that if
anything goes wrong,
i'm not gonna like losing
all that money,
and you won't like it,
either.
i understand. it is not pleasant
to lose money
once one becomes
accustomed to its use.
yeah. i don't back losers. . .
ever!
very practical.
so don't lose.
who was that?
i believe
he was threatening you.
  he was?
  yes!
if you don't win,
he means to harm you.
who can harm hercules?
he's a bad guy, herc.
gee. . .
i wish we didn't have nothing
to do with him.
you're okay, ain't you?
i'm fine.
pa: hercules the great
on stage!
well, that's you.
i'll see you later.
good luck.
thanks a lot.
okay, herc,
you're all ready.
remember everything i told you.
you won't forget. whatever you do,
don't get nervous.
i mean, just. . . just. . .
keep calm.
don't strain yourself because
you could get a hernia.
whatever you do, herc,
just stay calm.
and listen, herc,
watch out for monstro. . .
wasn't he something,
folks?
and now we have a special
treat for all you girls and guys.
an exhibition of
the defense of manly art.
speculation throughout
the city has been rife.
who is the strongest?
monstro the magnificent?
ooh, hey!
or hercules the great?
let's bring herc on.
you go out there
and get him.
remember what i taught you.
don't forget, now.
there he goes.
very glad to have you on the show.
whew!
now this contest of strength
will begin with the challenger,
monstro the magnificent,
who will snatch, press. . .
  that's ''clean and jerk.''
  i'm sorry.
who will clean and jerk
barbells weighing. . .
  500 pounds?
  500.
host: let's give him
a great big hand!
monstro the magnificent.
and now hercules the great.
and now,
item number two.
monstro the magnificent.
let's give him a hand.
not now, dum dum.
wonderful.
and now, hercules the great.
for hercules, 7 50 pounds,
ladies and gentlemen.
and now, ladies and gentlemen,
in this struggle of the titans,
one thousand pounds!
monstro the magnificent.
let's hear it for monstro!
host: ladies and gentlemen,
monstro the magnificent!
whoa, look at that!
look at that!
wonderful! wonderful!
monstro the magnificent!
host: and now,
hercules the great.
one thousand pounds.
double cross.
ladies and gentlemen,
let's have a hand for hercules.
a real effort.
a real effort.
host: and now the winner,
monstro the magnificent!
but, but what happened?
i don't know!
i could not lift it.
my strength,
it seemed to have gone.
come on,
we gotta get out of here!
there's no time to get dressed.
we'll go this way.
down the fire escape!
let's hear it,
ladies and gentlemen. come on!
let's hear it for monstro!
father, this is terrible.
we've got to go!
why, helen?
  come on.
  what's happened?
hercules is in trouble.
although that represents
no novelty, i find it forbidding.
he brought it on himself.
one thing
i do not understand. . .
i did not decree that hercules
should be bereft of his divinity.
it was my edict that
he be sent to pluto's kingdom
for a hundred years.
how, then, has this
other thing happened?
can nobody tell me?
  eros!
  yes, sir, zeus.
find nemesis.
bring her to me.
at once,
my liege zeus.
he should have been
back here by now.
his duds are here.
which means he ain't
coming back here!
outside!
get the boys!
get the boys.
get the boys.
there goes the dame.
the big phony and the runt
must be inside. let's go.
they're probably on the floor.
follow them.
don't lose them.
she left without
saying goodbye.
but don't you see
what she's doing?
she trying to draw them away
so we can escape.
you said those men
were dangerous.
dangerous!
boy, i'll say.
  h urry!
  where you going?
we have to stop those men.
on foot? you're gonna
chase them on foot?
  with the chariot.
  chariot? what chariot?
that's not a chariot.
what are you doing?
now he's done it!
man: hey, come back
with my chariot!
hey, mister!
wait for your sauerkraut!
man: hey ''muscles,'' that ain't
the way to disneyland!
we'll make mincemeat
out of those guys.
  coming up to a red light.
  forget about the light.
cut them off at the zoo.
don't let those punks
get away.
where is everybody?
where did that monster go
with my chariot?!
i want my chariot.
helen: we're out of gas!
let's get in there!
hercules doesn't flee
from anybody.
come on, herc!
no time to argue!
zeus sent for me?
when i ordered you
down to earth,
did i not charge you to see
that hercules
was delivered
to the realm of pluto?
  it is as zeus says.
  then, what happened?
how is it that hercules was
instead deprived of his divinity,
his strength,
and finds himself in his
present mortal predicament?
well. . .?
well!?
i was sent on another mission.
the substitute.
who gave you another mission
to supersede that of mine?
speak up, or i will blast you
where you stand!
here comes tony.
  where's all the other guys?
  i n the other cars.
okay, you take a couple of boys
and go in that door,
all the other guys,
come with me.
where are we going?
that way!
now, nemesis,
speak or i'll. . . !
no! no, mighty zeus.
i beg you!
it was juno.
she bade me do what i did.
so, interfering again.
i've told you i will not tolerate
your everlasting interference.
i thought it best,
to save a lot of trouble.
i will discuss this
with you later.
zeus, will you not save
hercules?
let him abide
by the consequences
of his own folly
and obstinacy.
oh, no. herc!
hercules is in great peril.
if zeus does not relent,
there's nothing we can do.
  there is.
  what?
we may send aid
to hercules.
we?
send help to hercules?
you know where to find them.
and they'll listen to you.
i know they will.
  who?
  atlas and samson.
hercules! get up!
come up here!
  come on, hercules.
  hercules, get up!
he's not coming.
are you all right, boy?
you all right?
go get them!
come on, go get them!
who sent atlas and samson
to hercules' aid?
is it not enough that hercules
has been causing
all that trouble
by himself?
call those other two away,
at once.
mercury. . .?
  zeus?
  was it you?
it was i .
how dare you
go above my head?
i feared
for hercules' safety.
bereft of his strength,
he's as helpless as a child
in the world of mortal men.
it is not to be borne.
hercules treated as a common
mortal by those scoundrels.
then save him, mighty zeus!
he deserves all he's getting.
when i want your opinion,
i'll ask for it.
hercules is a son of zeus.
i n treating him as they do,
those scoundrels down there
show disrespect for his father.
then save him,
great zeus,
even if it is only because
he is your son.
no mortal shall ever triumph
over a son of zeus!
i don't see nothing.
it's all very dark
in there.
fire torpedo!
aw, you gotta put
a dime in.
forget it.
you can see
all the way to jersey!
it's really something, huh?
i've never been up here,
you know.
kind of makes you
feel like. . .
some sort of god
or something.
too bad it's a little
cloudy today.
well, you can still see
pretty far.
i can see the whole river.
look at that big boat
down there.
you know, herc,
that looks like the boat
you were on.
take a look at it, herc,
i think it's. . .
hey, herc?
where'd you go, herc?
i have been willful.
i have been disobedient.
mighty zeus has more wisdom
than hercules.
he knew better
what is best for him.
please, mighty zeus, relent.
you'll be sorry.
zeus has only to speak now
for hercules to obey.
herc?
where'd you go, herc?
hey, herc!
herc!
h uh, strongest guy
in the world. . .
tying up with a nothing
like me.
imagine. . .
he really made me feel
like something. . .
a half pint like me.
i ain't never gonna
forget him.
never.
only, where did he go?
radio: don't grieve,
my friend.
i n the memory
that leaves you,
separation may have
a quiet happiness all its own.
herc?
we are friends, you and i .
and nothing can
take that from us.
herc?
herc!
where are you, herc?
what are you doing
in my radio?
herc. . .
it's me! it's pretzi!
why did you take a powder like that?
why did you just leave?
i didn't say anything
out of line, did i?
or do nothing?
did i , herc?
i enjoyed knowing you,
my little friend.
gee, herc.
ain't i never gonna
see you again?
ain't you never
coming back?
even for a visit?
'cause if you ain't,
it's sure gonna be
lonesome for me again.
herc, we really did
all them things, didn't we?
i didn't just imagine
all them things, did i?
it wasn't like what
the head shrinkers call,
''wishful thinking,''
was it, herc?
radio: any time you wish me
to be with you,
all you need to do
is think of me.
and there i shall be,
in your mind
and in your heart. . .
for as long as
you want me to be,
as long as you need me.
radio: due to temporary
atmospheric difficulties,
we were interrupted
in our broadcast.
we resume. . .
herc?
herc?
''any time you need me,
any time you want me,
just think of me,
and i'll be there
for as long as
you want me to.''
yeah.
i think i'll eat an apple.
and this is what i saw
on the world below.
it all sounds
revoltingly noisy.
leave me, now.
i would think
on what i've been told.
you, too, my love.

 you've spent most of your life turning your body into a model of excellence. why? what does having the world's greatest body mean to you?

 it means that i'm somebody special. what drove me to become the world's greatest bodybuilder is no different from what drives other athletes to become great tennis players or boxers or jockeys. i didn't get into body building until i was 15, and, at the time, my parents thought i was crazy to get deeply involved with something for which there was so little precedent in austria. they even thought of sending me to a psychiatrist. they couldn't see any future in the sport; but there i was, lifting weights two or three hours every day.

 did you have any idea then that body building would eventually bring you fame and fortune?

 no, not really. i was just locked into the idea of winning the world championship in body building. as time passed, i began to see it as a way out of austria, an escape from the everyday life around me. i'd look out my parents' window and see people talking over a cup of coffee for two hours or more, and i knew it wasn't for me. my father was the local police chief and he led a very regular life. i became determined to make it without working from nine to five. sports, i thought, was the only way to act out.

 but, at the time, were there really any bodybuilders who were making a living from the sport?

 there was a guy named reg park. he's an englishman who now lives in johannesburg, south africa, and he was my idol. he was publicized in the muscle magazines as a businessman and movie star, and the combination of the two so impressed me that all i could think of was winning the mr. universe title the fastest way possible. the basic problem, though, was that the americans had an enormous advantage. every mr. universe had come from america and, as it later turned out, i was the first one to break that pattern.

 why were the americans so successful? was it a question of having more money?

 no, it was because the americans had all the confidence. theirs was a mental superiority, the feeling that they owned the title. but in austria, the mentality was the reverse; winning against the americans was unthinkable. by the time i was 15, though, i had a vision of absolutely wiping everybody off the stage. i had no idea, really, of what a stage even looked like, but i saw myself standing there, posing and winning.

 an epiphany, a dream?

 a dream, yes, though not at night. it was just like having a vision-you know, like when you hear a person say, "i saw jesus and he talked to me, and now i'm so happy with life because i know i'm going to be taken care of," and all of a sudden he's relaxed, he's not haunted anymore-well, it was like that.

 when was this visionary sense of yourself confirmed?

 when i was 18 and still in the army, i entered the european body-building championship and won. it was my first competition and, even though it was the junior division, i instantly felt like king kong, as if i'd already won the mr. universe title-which, in fact, i did win a year later. the title itself wasn't so important to me as the lifestyle it brought with it. i was living in munich at the time, hanging out with night people-entertainers, hookers and bar owners-and i had a girlfriend who was a stripper. i was an innocent boy from a farm town, but i grew up fast in munich. then an american promoter wired me to come and compete in the states.

 was your training affected by the drinking and screwing around?

 no, because having a good time is not nearly so damaging as people think. i'm constantly amazed when people ask me about discipline. discipline is what you use when you don't want to do something, when you have to force yourself.

 you lift five and six tons daily because you enjoy it?

 yes, because i want to. do you have to discipline yourself to have breakfast, lunch or dinner? of course not; and so discipline-the usual concept of it-doesn't apply here. i had to discipline myself to learn english, but never to train.

 you never had to push yourself?

 absolutely not; at least, not the way most people think. i love body building. i positively get off on it. when you lift weights, there's a certain point in the repetitions at which it really starts aching-where you can't go on any further, and the body starts shaking, and you know you have to press one more time. that's where the satisfaction is: in going that one step further. that's why it gets painful. it's also what makes a champion. if you can't go through that pain period, that dead point, then competitively you won't make it.

 how do you deal with the pain?

 i look forward to it, and when it starts, i tell myself that i have to go through this because damn few people can. it's like any other sport: you have to do what nobody else can do, and the only way is to push yourself past the limit.

 do you have a training partner?

 yes. he helps push you through the pain periods. the relationship between the two of you is very close-closer than most marriages, in fact-and he has to understand when you're trying to chicken out, as well as when you really have to put the weights down, when you absolutely can't go on. he's looking after your body as if it were his own. sometimes your body really gets bombed out: you try to go through this pain thing, but your body won't push the weight, and your partner will help you with his fingers just enough so that you can handle it. he'll stand behind you and lift with his fingers and make it possible-but just barely possible-for you to make the lift, and then on the next repetition, maybe he'll help a little bit more.

 with just his fingers on the bar?

 just with the fingers, yes. maybe he's lifting five pounds, maybe only a single pound, but it can make all the difference. what it means is that somebody is helping, paying attention and really giving you his energy. it's all vibes: the two of you are out to conquer, to win. the two of you become a unit. you're working and nobody can get into your territory-it's that type of thing.

 it sounds as if your relationship with your training partner is so close that you wouldn't have much energy left for other relationships.

 no. my training. belongs to the gym, period. when i walk out, it's an absolutely different thing. i lived with a woman for five years, a very smart lady who teaches english at a college in california. she finally split when i went into the film business, not because of the training.

 still, you talk about the workouts as if they were taking place in a temple.

 yes and no. there's often a point where you say, "it's getting too intense here." your partner might be a little scared of the next set because you've been pushing him too hard, so you'll crack a joke and go over to somebody else and bullshit a little. then you talk him into it. the best example i can think of was one day when franco columbu walked into the gym, went down into a squat with 500 pounds on his shoulders and couldn't come back up. someone had to lift the weight off. i reminded franco that four people from new york were watching the great franco columbu, the world's strongest bodybuilder, crashing down under a mere 500 pounds. "franco," i told him, "this is very embarrassing. there are a lot of people here watching and they think that the muscle magazines are all bullshitting." he looked around and started breathing heavily, so i pushed it further. i bet him $20 in front of everybody that he couldn't do another repetition and then offered an additional $50 if he could go on and do eight reps. "bullshit!" he screamed. "i did it a few weeks ago and i can do it again." out of the door he went, took a few deep breaths and came back to do ten repetitions with the same weight-not eight but ten. do you think his body changed? no; his body was the same, his power was the same, but he was motivated. he ripped the weight out and just started going up and down as if there were no end, as if he were going to do 50 repetitions.

 can you push yourself too far?

 i've torn pectoral muscles, fibers in my knee, in my thighs, and once i had to have an operation to repair torn cartilage. generally you let muscles heal by themselves or get cortisone shots. injuries happen when your mind is beyond your body, largely when you think you're king kong and lift weights heavier than the body can handle. at the same time, though, we generally manage to have a good time. bodybuilders party a lot, and once, in gold's-the gym in venice, california, where all the top guys train-there was a black girl who came out naked. everybody jumped on her and took her upstairs, where we all got together.

 a gang bang?

 yes, but not everybody, just the guys who can fuck in front of other guys. not everybody can do that. some think that they don't have a big-enough cock, so they can't get a hard-on. having chicks around is the kind of thing that breaks up the intense training. it gives you relief, and then afterward you go back to the serious stuff.

 what do you think about when you look at yourself in the mirror? does your body become something outside yourself, an object?

 it's outside of me and also part of me. i don't say, "arnold, how do you look?" but rather "let's check out this body in the mirror and see what it looks like today." professionally, i have to be detached in order to be critical of it. i don't criticize myself; i criticize my body.

 with a body as perfect as yours, it seems strange to hear you talk of criticizing it.

 from the bodybuilder's point of view, my physique was perfect when i won my last title; yet i felt it could have been better. it's true that i was in perfect proportion, but i weighed 228 pounds and i wanted to be 240, overall just bigger. if you keep the proportions, bigger is always better. the goal is to carry the weight but keep the proportion and symmetry.

 does that mean that 300 pounds would be better than 240?

 no, because it wouldn't fit my height. i'm 6'2", and 240 pounds is the perfect weight for me.

 wouldn't your head be out of proportion if you weighed 240 pounds?

 no. visually that can be taken care of very easily. all you have to do is let the hair grow and you have a bigger head. also, in competition, the judges concentrate only on your physique. more than one mr. universe was an ugly son of a bitch.

 is your cock disproportionate to the rest of you?

 well, that depends on what you mean by disproportionate. the cock isn't a muscle, so it doesn't grow in relation to the shoulders, say, or the pectorals. you can't make it bigger through exercise, that's for sure. besides, i've never even heard of a bodybuilder who's tried to make his bigger.

 really?

 really, though in my case, women have told me they're curious about its size-you know, outgoing chicks who're just trying to be outrageous or horny. i hear all kinds of lines, including "oh, you're hurting me; you're so big." but it means nothing. bodybuilders' cocks are the same size as everyone else's.

 many people think that bodybuilders see their physique as an instrument for getting laid. is that true?

 are you asking if my basic motivation in building my body was to pick up girls? that's ridiculous. there are many easier ways to pick up girls, believe me. of course, i do use what i have when it comes in handy. if nothing else, my body's a conversation piece.

 are you embarrassed by that?

 not at all. a girl can talk about my nose, my teeth or my accent-anything that gets a conversation going is fine with me. it is weird, though, the way women respond to my body. maybe 50 percent respond positively right away, while another 25 or 30 percent need a while to adjust to my size and to realize that ordinarily my muscles are soft, just like anyone's, only bigger. a number of women, however, will say, "you're way too big for me; i don't like that."

 what kinds of women generally come on to you?

 i can't categorize them. i've been approached by waitresses, stewardesses, teachers-come to think of it, there have been a great many teachers, women who are smart. their trip is such a mental one that they are often attracted to men who are big and muscular.

 do you feel exploited by such women?

 no, i'd feel used only if i didn't get something out of it. if a girl comes on strong and says, "i really dig your body and i want to fuck the shit out of you," i just decide whether or not i like her. if i do take her home, i try to make sure i get just as much out of it as she does. the word exploited therefore wouldn't apply.

 do you think that your familiarity with your body gives you a sounder mind sexually?

 i don't have any sexual hang-ups, but i'm sure there are bodybuilders who have trouble with sex, and obviously the body building hasn't helped. still, if you're in touch with your body, you certainly have an enormous sexual advantage. the mind-body connection is the same in sex as it is in training. if i tell myself to train the thighs, then the calves, it's boom, boom, mind-thighs, mind-calves, mind-this, mind-that. and it's the same with fucking-mind-cock. you're in touch. you realize you have a body. ninety percent of the people, though, don't realize that there is anything below the head. they think that the head is carried around by something very mysterious, and they're not aware that it's the body, something they should be in tune with.

 stirling moss, the british racing-car champion, claimed that he'd never fuck the night before a race because it would sap his competitive drive. does anything like that apply to bodybuilders, say, on the eve of the mr. olympia contest?

 i get laid on purpose. i can't sleep before competition and i'm up all night, anyway, so instead of staring at the ceiling i figure i might as well find somebody and fuck.

 doesn't it take the edge off your performance?

 no, why should it? for ten years, i've been building a physique. it's not going to run away after one night. what moss and others are talking about is a totally mental thing: if you feel that something's going to affect your body, then it definitely will. i've always found that sex gives me a kind of calm, and i'm much more in control because of it. it's the same for friends of mine who are also top bodybuilders. the guys who are working their way up often say they have to sleep ten hours a day and they try not to get laid more than three times a week, but, sooner or later, most of them find out that all this means shit. whether you sleep two hours or ten, get laid a dozen times a week or not at all, eat three meals or five, at the end of the week you look absolutely the same; there's no difference.

 so you believe in writing your own rules?

 exactly. there are bodybuilders who are afraid of indulging in sex or even of playing other sports for fear of harming their bodies. i think that's silly. what's the use of building your body if you don't use it? at the mr. olympia contest in 1972, we had girls backstage giving head, then all of us went out and i won. it didn't bother me at all; in fact, i went out there feeling like king kong.

 this business of feeling like king kong-is it your act to psych everyone out so they know you're king kong?

 in the past five or six years, i haven't had to do that, but i used to do all kinds of numbers in the gym just to make it clear that i was the best. gold's gym has produced ten or 12 mr. americas, and obviously there were guys there who wanted to take the mr. universe title away from me. what i do is make them feel great. i tell a guy that he's never looked better, that he looks brilliant, fantastic. "your deltoids! and how did you get the tan and the proportion? i'm positive that you'll place; you'll beat frank; i think you'll even beat corney. you can easily beat this guy and that guy. i'm certain you'll go all the way-to second place."

 is there a code of dos and don'ts in a championship?

 of course; but when you become a star almost anything goes. it's like ali doing something dirty in the ring-not many people are going to take it too seriously. you're not supposed to talk while you're posing, for example, yet i used to do it all the time and it would blow the other guys' minds. if we were going through the compulsory poses-a double-biceps pose, say-i'd just turn to the guy next to me and say, "what a shame, what a disadvantage for you," or i'd psych him in reverse by aying that the disadvantage was mine, that he was definitely going to be the one to win. once, i even sent a guy offstage. he was enormous, really fantastic, and the audience was screaming for both of us, so you knew it was going to be close. after about 15 minutes of posing, i told him i thought i'd had enough and that we ought to quit, just walk off. he agreed, turned around and left and i just stayed on. the audience immediately turned against him and i won-my first mr. olympia title, in 1970.

 what percentage of bodybuilders is gay?

 the percentage of gays is the same, probably, as anywhere. most bodybuilders are straight, regular street guys, though a lot aren't serious. many in california are punks, beach bums just lying around in the sun and maybe collecting unemployment.

 many people think that bodybuilders eventually become muscle-bound. is this true?

 the general definition of being muscle-bound is that you have so many muscles that you can't move freely. i don't know of any bodybuilder in that category; in fact, many of them are quite active in other sports. columbu, for instance, was the italian boxing champion. ken waller was a football player and mike katz played for the jets. robbie robinson runs the 100-yard dash in 9.3 seconds. when the russians were lifting weights in preparation for the olympics-for the shot-put, the hammer throw and things like that-the americans picked up on it immediately. then there's the russian master weight lifter, alexiev. do you know what speed it takes to do a snatch, to lift a 700- or 800-pound bar bell so fast that you can raise it over your head? alexiev can't run because he weighs 375 pounds, a weight he needs in order to handle the bar bell. the olympic decathlon champion, bruce jenner, is one of the world's best athletes. when training for the olympics, he lifted weights for two hours daily, squatting with almost 500 pounds. the idea of a muscle-bound freak is nothing but a myth.

 do you look at other people's bodies as objectively as you look at your own?

 no, i look at bodies differently in the gym than i do elsewhere. for example, many women seem to have hang-ups about going out with me because they feel they have to be in the same shape that i am. if they're overweight, they're insecure, because they don't understand that i don't look at women the same way i look at myself. i'm a competitive bodybuilder; i'm not training just to be healthy. ninety-five percent of the people training with weights are into this health thing, and it's a different mentality entirely. as far as i'm concerned, it's bullshit; otherwise i wouldn't drink. i make my protein drink with whiskey. people think i'm crazy, but that's the way i am. i get stoned, i do my own thing.

 do you use dope?

 yes, grass and hash-no hard drugs. but the point is that i do what i feel like doing. i'm not on a health kick. i know i should take vitamins, for example, but i forget half the time. i just can't be bothered carrying around a lot of little bottles. once i get outside the gym, i forget all about body building. i can look at a chick who's a little out of shape and if she turns me on, i won't hesitate to date her. if she's a good fuck, she can weigh 150 pounds, i don't care.

 do you get freaked out by being in such close contact with men in the gym?

 not at all. when i was playing soccer at the age of 14, the first thing we'd do before going out onto the field would be to climb up on one another's thighs and massage the legs; it was a regular thing. none of us had a thought of being gay, absolutely not, and it's the same with most bodybuilders. men shouldn't feel like fags just because they want to have nice-looking bodies. another thing: recently i posed for a gay magazine, which caused much comment. but it doesn't bother me. gay people are fighting the same kind of stereotyping that bodybuilders are: people have certain misconceptions about them just as they do about us. well, i have absolutely no hang-ups about the fag business; though it may bother some bodybuilders, it doesn't affect me at all.

 is there a broader acceptance of the body these days, as an offshoot of the sexual revolution of the sixties?

 yes. i've been in america for only eight years, but there's been a change and it's getting better. it's happening in europe, too. people are more at ease with their bodies.

 being at ease is one thing, but whatever possessed you to pose for the whitney museum?

 a woman from the new york times had been doing a piece on body building. she came to the gym and asked if corney and i would pose at the museum. i thought at once that it was a terrific idea. i'd always wanted to tell people that when i work on my body i'm thinking about classical sculpture, so i jumped at the chance to show off body building as an art form. after the show, a lot of people came backstage and said it was fantastic, that they'd never thought of body building as art before.

 didn't you feel like a pet monkey performing for the east side ladies?

 no, i felt great because i was the first athlete to be in a museum displaying his work of art, which just happened to be my physique. overall, it was a great success. what does piss me off, though, is when people try to trick me into going to parties. you know, rich people in beverly hills who want to make the gossip columns.

 now that you've retired from professional body-building competition and are concentrating on acting, don't you need the hollywood publicity?

 if that's the kind of publicity i have to depend on, i'm a sad, sad case. i don't choose my friends for publicity purposes. jon voight, warren beatty, sylvester stallone-i've gotten to know these people and they're a lot of fun. stallone's into body building, and jack nicholson had a birthday party for me after we finished stay hungry. all my bodybuilder friends were there, really a mixed crowd-actors, bodybuilders, weight lifters, karate guys and writers-and it was great. the other kind of party, though, where someone's trying to rip you off-no, thanks.

 are you serious about becoming a professional actor?

 yes, i've been going to acting school and i know that this is what i really want to do. at the moment, i'm looking for the right vehicles, and i pretty much know what i want. do you know hemingway's short story the killers? i'd like to do a remake, play the guy the two mobsters are after-the swede. i realize there's only one arnold in the world, that there's never been an arnold before, and the one thing that won't work on the screen is my being an ass-kicker. if robert de niro kills in taxi driver, it's perfect, because he's a little guy and people are 100 percent behind him. for me, that isn't the right kind of role, because i'm big and therefore i have to play the opposite kind of guy. when you build a career, you should never imitate anybody. if there's one thing i ought to do, it's the unexpected. whether it's the killers or something else, i probably should play the victim. 

oh, like i said. i'm busy anyway, so give this job to my friend here. he loves playing in the jungle. right?
right.
that's right.
hey, why don't we have dinner?
sure. when?
in a thousand years?
too soon.
what's his fucking problem?
he wants to be president.
only an idiot would do this job.
how much?
like i said.
have you been sick? you've lost weight.
whatever i've lost you've found, pal.
you guys aren't gonna start sucking each other's dicks are you? let's get down to business, see who wants to work. you ever hear of an island called vilena?
no.
yeah. it's a little island in the gulf.
that's right.
you should read more.
thanks.

it's the most difficult decision i've made in my entire life, except the one i made in 1978 when i decided to get a bikini wax.
i can promise you that when i go to sacramento, i will pump up sacramento.
as you know, i don't need to take any money from anybody. i have plenty of money myself. i will make the decisions for the people.
we have to make sure everyone in california has a great job. a fantastic job!


i saw this toilet bowl. how many times do you get away with this, to take a woman, grab her upside down, and bury her face in a toilet bowl? i wanted to have something floating there ... the thing is, you can do it, because in the end, i didn't do it to a woman, she's a machine! we could get away with it without being crucified by who-knows-what group.

as much as when you see a blonde with great tits and a great ass, you say to yourself, 'hey, she must be stupid or must have nothing else to offer,' which maybe is the case many times. but then again there is the one that is as smart as her breasts look, great as her face looks, beautiful as her whole body looks gorgeous, you know, so people are shocked.

having a pump is like having sex. i train two, sometimes three times a day. each time i get a pump. it's great. i feel like i'm cumming all day.

i think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman.

i have inhaled, exhaled everything.

that was another thing i will never forgive the republican party for. i was ashamed to call myself a republican during that period.

i can look at a chick who's a little out of shape and if she turns me on, i won't hesitate to date her. if she's a good fuck she can weigh 150 pounds, i don't care.

having chicks around is the kind of thing that breaks up the intense training. it gives you relief, and then afterward you go back to the serious stuff.

the cock isn't a muscle so it doesn't grow in relation to the shoulders, say, or the pectorals. you can't make it bigger through exercise, that's for sure.

nixon was always being attacked sexually. it was always said that he was a fag and that he had no sexual relations with his wife for 15 years and that was why he liked power. and hitler had only one ball, and that was why he wanted to conquer the world.

my friends don't want me to mention kurt's name, because of all the recent nazi stuff and the u.n. controversy, but i love him and maria does too, and so thank you, kurt.

 my friends don't want me to mention kurt's name, because of all the recent nazi stuff and the u.n. controversy, but i love him and maria does too, and so thank you, kurt. 

 my relationship to power and authority is that i'm all for it. people need somebody to watch over them. ninety-five percent of the people in the world need to be told what to do and how to behave. 

 i was always dreaming about very powerful people, dictators and things like that. i was just always impressed by people who could be remembered for hundreds of years, or even, like jesus, be for thousands of years remembered. 

 i think that the only way that you really keep it a secret is by not telling anyone. 

 and you know something, because everything that i've gotten-my career, my money, my family; everything that i've gotten and achieved is because of california. 

 and this is a process that was a very long and very difficult process, because you have to put all of those things on a scale. you have to put on a scale, you know, that you're stopping with the movie career, you're stopping some of the business relationships that make you a lot of money. 

 it doesn't matter if you are a democrat or republican, if you're young or old, what the racial thing is, nothing matters to me. 

 after watching mulattas shake it, i can totally understand why brazil is devoted to my favorite body part, the ass. 

 bodybuilders party a lot, and once, in gold's--the gym in venice, california, where all the top guys train there was a black girl who came out naked. everybody jumped on her and took her upstairs, where we all got together. 

 obviously, i've made statements that were ludicrous and crazy and outrageous and all those things, because that's the way i always was. 

 whatever i thought might hold me back, i avoided. i crossed girls off my list, except as tools for my sexual needs. 

 if i see a girl with big tits, i'm going to stare and stare. and i'm going to think in my mind what i am going to do with her if i would have her. 

 you have to do everything possible to win no matter what. 

 i was born to be a leader. i love the fact that millions of people look up to me. 

 i will not change. because if you are successful and you change, you are an idiot. 

 i knew i was destined for great things. people will say that kind of thinking is totally immodest. i agree. modesty is not a word that applies to me in any way-i hope it never will. 

 my friend james cameron and i made three films together-true lies, the terminator and terminator 2. of course, that was during his early, low-budget, art-house period. 

 i love thanksgiving turkey...it's the only time in los angeles that you see natural breasts. 

 the public doesn't care about figures. 

 don't worry about that. 


you campaigned as a reformer. eight years later, were you?
i went in thinking, i'm not going into office to accept the status quo-otherwise there's no reason for me to run, i just ought to do another movie. i'm going to fight the battles that people normally don't want to fight.

like what?
in 2005 they spent $160 million against me because i wanted to reform pensions, education, and the budget system. and now finally we got those things. it took seven years, but we've finally approved a solar-power initiative that will generate 3,000 megawatts of renewable energy. in 2006 we passed ab32, which will reduce greenhouse-gas levels to 1990 levels. it took years to do those things, but i fought and fought and fought. we got the pension reform, we got the budget reform, we did the things that we wanted to do.

 you're often called a post-partisan politician. do you think it's time for a new party?

 i'm sure the united states can handle another party. but the more critical thing is that we look at things in a different way and not always do the same thing over and over again. i don't accept the fact that you have to have democrats and republicans that see things in opposite ways.

my father-in-law, sargent shriver, always talked about this. he said it was important that we find the things that we have in common. if it is just family things with children that we all love, you know, let's talk about that. we all want good education, so how do we go about it? for example, if the republicans get rubbed the wrong way about global warming, then let me talk about oil independence. or take global warming: if i say that pollution causes a lot of problems with health-nineteen thousand people in california, a hundred thousand people nationwide, are dying because of pollution-related illnesses-both parties have to be interested in that, in health, even though they might not agree on global warming.

 and your next act?

 well, it evolves. i never stop anything. so i started the bodybuilding and i'm still doing bodybuilding. i committed to acting and i still do acting. and now i've gotten into politics, and i will continue doing politics and being a public servant in one way or the other. and doing something for the community and giving something back to the state or to the country. getting involved in environmental issues and policy issues, in government, political reform, and all of those things. you know, the menu becomes bigger. that's the great thing: the older i get, the bigger the menu.

 it seems like you're resistant to sitting still.

 i can only operate to the utmost and to 100 percent of my potential if i have no safety net. because it's only then that i'm at my peak. that's one reason i never did tv shows-i didn't want to have that security. what i liked about being governor was never knowing how a meeting would end. the legislative leaders could leave and destroy you to the press. or they go out and compliment you. so you don't know. you don't know the way the people go. one year they like something, the next year it's number seven on their priority list. so you just never know. that brings excitement and spice to life. and that to me is the difference between living and existing.

 not too long ago, you were the proud owner of several gas-guzzling hummer monster cars. but now that you've become the "green governor," you seem to have stopped using them. is there any truth to the rumors that you've sold your fleet?

 i regularly buy and sell cars, but i do not buy and sell fleets.

 so you still own your hummers? is that really the right car for someone who wants to protect the environment?

 these are no ordinary hummers. i had general motors customize one of them into a hydrogen hummer. it's the only hummer in the world with that motor. i had another converted from diesel to biofuel. but now that i am governor, i am no longer able to drive these cars because i am driven by the california highway patrol. my hummers are usually in the garage.

 is it not an odd compromise to transform an energy-wasting hummer into an environmentally friendly car? wouldn't it be easier for you to just go out and buy a smaller car?

 not at all. the message i am trying to get across is exactly this: protecting the environment does not require us to be against large suvs or trucks. instead we should develop technology to cut down greenhouse gas emissions because that is where the action is, it's not about what the size of the car is. we just have to redo the vehicles.

 so is it the new california dream to do good without having to eschew luxury? is it possible to be wasteful and conservationist at the same time?

 yes, it's fantastic. a short while ago, our office became the first in the country to receive the first bmw luxury 7 series hydrogen car. bmw made 100 of them and they gave them to 100 opinion-makers, stars and people with high visibility. when those people drive around it again sells the idea that it is cool to drive a hydrogen car. but that doesn't mean that you should take this big car and make it smaller. instead we should be saying: keep the luxury car!

 so as long as the economy doesn't become a victim of the environment, you will continue to be comfortable being called the green governor?

 i love it, it's great. when i was campaigning last year, everything was green in order to get the message across. i even held a press conference with the ocean in the background. i said: those oil rigs you see out there will be gone eventually because we now know that environmental pollution is counterproductive and that we could be slowly killing ourselves with climate change.

 you're not the only person in america who has gone green. other people, including al gore, also identify themselves with the issue. has global warming become a political fad?

 i think the momentum is gigantic. it reminds me of my bodybuilding days. at first, bodybuilding was relatively unknown, but we promoted the sport and it spread like wildfire. when you travel around the world today, you never have to look far for a gym like in the old days. if you ask, people say, "of course, the hotel has one."

 what sparked this new sense of environmental consciousness? was it high gas prices and the recognition that america is dependent on middle east energy supplies?

 we do not like the fact that we must rely on fossil fuels. this dependence is a huge mistake. it's as bad as having an investor who only invests in a single product or company. you have to diversify. you have to invest in 30 different companies because that is the only way you can guarantee that your investment will grow. we have not done that with our energy.

  former vice president al gore just received an oscar for his documentary film "an inconvenient truth." aren't you afraid he might steal the limelight from you?

 i don't think so. the most interesting thing politically is that republicans are now supporting environmental protection. we've always expected nothing less from the democrats. as a republican, people expected me to protect the oil companies and business. now they are surprised that i talk about greenhouse gases. but it's true that the documentary has now given gore tremendous legitimacy. california is now passing new environmental laws that gore was actually talking about 20 years ago. he was right, but people called him a tree hugger because he's a democrat.

 quite a comeback for al gore. do you think he might even run for president again?

 he may wait a little bit to see how it plays out with the others; hillary clinton and barack obama. it could very well be that he joins the race.

 but won't climate change play more of a secondary role behind the war in iraq in the 2008 campaign?

 i don't know. right now iraq is a big issue. but in politics things change so quickly you can never count on anything. when i became governor, we had budget problems. that's different now. i hope it will be the same with the iraq war. i hope that it is not the issue that every candidate always gets asked about, but that they also talk about infrastructure in the united states, about health care, immigration and the other important issues facing us.

 ever since john f. kennedy was president, hollywood has been an important part of presidential campaigns. what role will hollywood play in this election?

 hollywood always plays a huge role. hollywood has a lot of money. candidates get more money from hollywood than anywhere else. but this time it will be split between a number of different candidates. producers steven spielberg and david geffen are doing fundraisers for barack obama, other groups will be doing fundraisers for hillary clinton and still others will be doing them for john edwards. hollywood is split this time.

 traditionally, california only comes out in support of a candidate later in the campaign, often when it has already been decided. what role do you expect california to play in the campaign this time?

 a big role. that's why we moved our primary up from june to february. it will change the whole ballgame because california, the biggest state of all, is right there in the beginning. it will make us the most important player in the race.

 you have talked a lot about a new era of bipartisanship, of blind party loyalty being passe. would you go so far as to endorse a democrat?

 no, because we have great candidates who are running. they are simply good and they are very much in the political center, especially rudy giuliani and john mccain.

 what will be the decisive factor in the election?

 we have to watch both the republican and democratic candidates and see who is most willing to cross the aisle and work with the other party. this is the most important thing.

 do you think the country is fed up with partisanship?

 unbelievably fed up.

 that comes from someone who, two years ago, wanted to pass radical reforms in california over the objections of democrats. you called people who wanted compromise girly men. did you change your mind?

 i changed my mind, yes. but i did not call anyone "girly men" because they wanted to compromise. i called them girly men because they didn't want to make the decisions that were right for california.

 you also picked a fight with some of the most powerful lobby groups in the state. you said you wanted to kick their butts.

  was it the right thing? no. i should have put more effort in negotiating instead of accusing them of all kinds of things. my tone was a tone of confrontation and was wrong. if you really want to accomplish things, that is not the way to go.

 back then, your approval ratings fell dramatically, down from 60 to 30 percent. you had to change course to survive politically.

 politics is not really different from marriage. you cannot get things done in your relationship if you tell your wife: look, if you haven't made the bed and if you don't get the food on the table, i will go and just hire someone and you will become irrelevant. that is not how you make a marriage work.

 has the united states entered into a post-bush era in which an unwavering ideological line is seen more as a vice than a virtue?

 i'm not sure things are that simple with bush. when he was still governor of texas, he ran his state in the most bipartisan of ways. i do not know why it has gone so differently washington. i think washington just does something to people.

 when you were there recently, you strongly challenged president bush. you said he should make more compromises and talk nice with the democrats.

 i did not challenge him, that is not the right word. i gave him some suggestions about what he should do. it is very clear that we have to work together in order to do a good job. what is really hurting the country is the way they are governing in washington at the moment.

 for a long time, you were a proponent of the iraq war. now you're in favor of a gradual withdrawal of the troops. wouldn't the united states be giving up its influence in the region by withdrawing?

 you change your positions as things change. i had different information from the president. i only get the information that washington shares with us and that is broadcast in the media. it seemed clear at the time that iraq was sheltering terrorists. saddam hussein's regime was a dictatorship that cost a lot of lives. there was good justification to invade, especially after 9/11.

 now you have called for an end to the war.

 that's right. four years later, we have to look at it and ask if iraq is becoming another vietnam, and i do not want it to become another vietnam. i think we have now helped the iraqi government long enough. we have trained their soldiers. we have done everything that we can, so now let's talk about a timeline of withdrawal.

 do you have a specific timeline for withdrawal in mind?

 i raised that issue at the white house and it was made clear to me that there might be a plan like this but they would never even talk about that because they do not want to signal to the other side what the plan is. we should have an end in sight for this war. it costs a fortune and it costs a lot of lives.

 one of your duties is to write letters of condolence to the families of soldiers killed in iraq. have you ever attended a funeral?

 i go to funerals for firefighters, police officers, law enforcement officials, but i have never been to the funeral of a dead soldier.

 why not?

 there are just too many.

 how many?

 a few hundred. it has been a big loss.

  there was a time when a so-called lex schwarzenegger was being worked on, namely a new law that would give american citizens who were not been born in the united states the right to become president. why didn't that work out?

 i think that eventually it will be changed, but it will take a while. maybe 10 or 20 years down the line it will benefit not me but someone else. it must be part of a comprehensive immigration reform.

 would you like to be part of the next government, say as secretary of state?

 i have no thoughts about that because i think 24 hours a day about this job that i have.

 that's what they all say.

 i never like to think more than just a few days ahead. the reason i chose to come to the us is because there is no safety net here. i chose making movies over doing tv series because i didn't want to know what my next move would be. i like the idea of the risk. if a movie goes in the toilet then you get no new offers. if the movie does well, then you have 15 scripts in front of you. i always feel that if you pay 100 percent attention to what you are doing then you have every option available in the future. these things fall into place. i have total faith in my future.

  when i was 15 years old i felt totally confident i would become a world champion and the greatest bodybuilder in the world. the same was true of show business. I knew that one day i would make more money than anyone else in the industry and i did. for that you need the willingness to work and do everything it takes to make the vision turn into reality. those are the kinds of things that you also need in politics. there are thousands of experts here in sacramento, but at the end of the day, it's all about taking something on and seeing it through to the end. that's the perfect job for me.

 mr. governor, we thank you for this interview.

would you ever hang out with snoop lion if he asked?
i think he is great. we've done a show together before, and he was hilarious.

huh, i guess you must have told us last time that you'd be back.
always.

of all the things you are famous for, which are you most proud of?
which are you least proud of?
i'm most proud that i was smart enough to immigrate to the greatest country in the world where i could accomplish all of my dreams.
i'm least proud of the mistakes i made that caused my family pain and split us up.

did andre the giant really pick you up and carry you back to a table when you tried to pick up the cheque?
yes, he picked me up. but he set me on a car outside.

really simple question: how are you doing today?
fantastic. can't complain! thank you.

what is nearest you have ever been to death?
i have two from movies.
on the 6th day, there was a scene where i hide underwater behind embryos. i did a rehearsal with goggles and everything went fine. but when we actually shot, i couldn't see because the water was milky. so i ran out of air and went to the top and realized i didn't know where to get out. i was trapped. then a hand grabbed me and pulled me out. it was my stunt double, billy lucas. he'd been watching from below with a tank and goggles and realized i was in big, big trouble.
on true lies, you probably remember the horse scene. there was a shot where the horse had to stop at the edge of a building. they built a little ramp to give the horse longer to stop. but when they were measuring the new distance from the ramp to the camera, they dropped the arm of the camera on the horse's nose, and it went crazy, spinning and rearing. there was no rail, and the ramp was only 4 feet wide. i realized it was a bad situation and i slid off the horse right away and a stunt man grabbed me. that one was really scary. if the horse stepped a foot the wrong way, we would have fallen 90 feet to a cement floor.
these stories are why i will always love stunt people.

i signed the bill because it was the right thing to do.
the only displeasure we heard was from the turkish government. interestingly, a year later, i was at a un conference getting an award for environmental work and i was seated next to the turkish ambassador. he was very complimentary and there was no mention of the legislation!

did you really mix your protein with whiskey sometimes like you said in a 1977 interview?
no, i used schnapps. but yes, i did mix alcohol in to some of my protein drinks.

did the predator ever make you shit yourself? it did for me when i was younger
not because of the predator. but during the shooting of the movie, i got really sick in puerto vallerta.
i will spare you the details, but while i was on a run, the runs hit. i ran to the side of the road and some cars driving by got quite the show.

what do you usually eat on your "cheat day"?
schnitzel, kaiserschmarrn, ice cream. you really can't go wrong with austrian food when you want to indulge.

hi arnold. thanks for coming back.
i just want to mention that we have an opening for a full-time position on our community team.
we offer competitive salary and benefits, and one of our perks includes up to $500 reimbursable per year for gym memberships to encourage a healthy lifestyle. under certain circumstances, you would also be authorized to wield the banhammer, although we have been especially impressed with your ability to resolve conflicts with well-chosen words.
we feel you would make a great addition to the team, and encourage you to apply for the position.
that's more than i made as governor. i'm in!

how do you feel about this photo?
small.

i remember hearing that james cameron did not originally want you for the role of the terminator. but then you guys went for lunch and he changed his mind. if this is true what did you say or do to convince him you were right for the role?
huge fan by the way!
actually, the story is a little different. i wanted the role of kyle reese when we went to lunch. i did not want to be the terminator. i didn't think i had established myself yet enough as a hero to be a villain. when i started in hollywood, all they offered was villains. so i wanted to really establish myself first.
but i told jim some of my ideas about how the terminator should train, for example not looking while loading weapons, not blinking, no emotions. i said the guy had to train blindfolded. the terminator, by the way, at that time, was o.j. simpson.
jim told me i had to do it. he was right.

please... please record yourself saying "come with me if you want to lift"
done.

smoking a cigar, on a tank, with arnold is possibly the manliest thing anyone will ever do.
no question. i love to drive the tank, so letting a fan be part of it is fantastic for me.

what is coming to bud light in february? i do not want to wait.
i had a great time filming that. but you'll have to wait for the super bowl.
but, i have noticed lately people love to put me in disguises. you obviously saw the bjorn borg look. but i also made this video with reddit in mind, so i might as well put it out now. i play howard, gold's gym field manager.

you're conan the barbarian, mr. olympia, the fucking terminator. but i want to know: what is the most feminine part of you?
besides junior? i like to paint. i paint all of my christmas cards. example: http://imgur.com/7f6rbxy
i also drew a cat for my reddit secret santa, but i can't find the link quickly.

here's the secret santa, lucky woman...
thanks!

hey arnold, i met you at the un a few years ago, you walked up to me and said "how you doing?" and i was immediately frozen in place.
anyways, what is your favorite cigar?
great to meet you. right now i'm smoking a partagas series p no. 1.

hey arnold, what's the story behind this picture?
i was in cannes to promote pumping iron during the film festival. i did outrageous photo-ops all over. i thought throwing the law enforcement guys off the boat was a great one.
and i saw the photoshop battles. you guys are hilarious.

so, you're a big guy and an action movie star, but when was the last time you were in an actual physical confrontation? not that you would promote violence or anything, but shit happens, right? did you win the fight?
a few months ago, i got rear-ended by this guy. he took off, and i chased him. i will admit i drove at a slightly excessive speed. i cut him off, and two guys jumped out of the car looking tough.
but when they saw me, they just said, "oh shit! the terminator!" they were nice, and gave me their information.

painted a picture of you in my gym, had a pretty good response off the reddit community, what do you think?
that's really great. thank you for sharing.

hello mr. schwarzenegger!
i'm such a huge fan of your work and thank you so much for it
my question is: how do you feel about women pursuing bodybuilding? (both competitively and non-competitively)
sending you lots of love from the u.k.
i love it. i always support women doing exactly the same sports as men, including bodybuilding. i have always supported women lifting weights and female bodybuilding. i think people have too many misconceptions about that. lifting is so important.
as a matter of fact, george snyder and i organized the first ms. olympia (in pennsylvania) and then i continued to support it and organize at my events in columbus.

hey arnold, long time fan. couple of questions:
how do you like having your own range of supplements? have you been using them? if i take them will i be able to kill predator?
i feel like my deltoids are really lacking. any particular dumbbell exercises you feel really work for you on the deltoids? (i only have access to dumbbells)
you guys think i should try arnold press. don't steal arnold's thunder.
arnold responded to me. i will now die a happy man.
it is fantastic to have my own line. it's something i waited a long time to do and i'm happy to have them formulated with what i consider the best ingredients to recover and rest. i don't know if you could beat the predator, but you could set a few new records for yourself. and yes, i take them.
perfect. dumbbells are better than barbells for your delts. first, the arnold press. start with a weight you can do 6 times. after 6, pick the next weight down. work down the rack and do at least five sets. no rest, because picking up the lighter weight should be easy. once you finish that, do lateral raises the same way. when i did this, i couldn't move my arms after, but it works.

warum hast du dich in den deutschen versionen deiner filme nie selbst synchronisiert? why didn't you dub yourself in the german versions of your movies?
sometimes i was doing 2 or 3 movies a year, and it was hard to get the timing right to sit in the studio and do the looping. so it was just easier to have someone who has a similar voice do it.
i did do a scene in german in escape plan, though.

i know this will probably be buried... my grandmother is a huge fan of you. she lives in venezuela and due to the situation with the government there, doesn't get a chance to come visit often. but when she does all she wants to do is stay at home watching your movies. she doesn't speak english, so whenever i ask her what she's watching, she just looks at me and says "arnold". when i ask her what's going on in the movie she simply responds with "arnold is kicking some guys ass". she absolutely loves you and her birthday is coming up soon. i wanted to ask you if you could just simply write on a piece of paper "feliz cumpleanos anriett merjech" and take a picture. it would mean the absolute world to me and to my grandmother! she's getting old and i really know she would appreciate it. you have no idea what this would mean for her!! i hope you get to see this, if not, then i just wanted to thank you for all the laughs, gasps, and hilarious cursing i have been able to share with her through your movies.
here you go. tell her thanks for being a fan!

hi arnie! arrerggghhhh..uggghhhhhhhh...uyurrrrggghhhhhrrr...!
your films got me through chemo dude. i was 12, i had non hodgkin's lymphoma. i used to watch your movies religiously after my dad got me into them. i saw you as the chemo and the bad guys in the movies as the cancer. you always won and it made me feel good, coz in my head, you were kicking my lymphomas ass! even the funny ones like kindergarten cop or twins... it was my way of dealing with it all. i have seen every single one of your movies and documentaries. you are kind of a big deal in my family. thanks for being awesome and making sweet films. i hope to meet you some day. it's on my bucket list! i don't have any questions. i'm just kinda stoked you might see this. nothing but luv dude. from south london uk.
thanks.

apparently i broke a rule at r/askreddit. that's ok, because one of my life rules is actually "break some rules." i am reposting this here and asking for your ideas. bring it on. and don't worry, i got the message about the bubble wrap before it was removed.
a while ago i asked reddit for help raising money for my fundraiser to ride my tank with me to raise money for after-school all-stars (http://www.omaze.com/arnold), and the top video people wanted me to film was "will it crush?"

i most regret not doing the rock. i love the movie, and it turned out well. when it was offered to me there was only an 80 page script with a lot of handwriting and scribbles and it didn't seem fully baked. but they obviously did a fantastic job.

i would like to work with michael bay and steven spielberg. also sam raimi would be great to work with.

in your films are all the "ayyaagh's" in the script or do you improvise them?
all improvised. every single one.

the most important thing is that we need to be a party that is inclusive and tolerant. we can be those things and be the party we always have been. we need to think about the environment - teddy roosevelt was a great environmentalist and people forget reagan was the one who dealt with the ozone layer with the montreal protocol. we also need to talk about healthcare honestly - nixon almost passed universal healthcare. we need to have an talk about immigration and realize you can't just deport people. we need a comprehensive answer. we also need to stay out of people's bedrooms. the party that is for small government shouldn't be over-reaching into people's private lives.

would you rather fight 100 duck sized predators or 1 predator sized duck?
i would choose the 1 predator sized duck instead of dealing with 100 duck-sized predators. i've already fought a predator-sized predator so i am confident i could handle the duck.

 it's a story of your life. obviously attention is being brought to the other side of your life, your relationship, your wife, the affair, the child, etc. from your perspective, why? i mean, you have a beautiful wife, beautiful family, everything going for you, where's the disconnect?
  i think as i explained in the book, i created a huge screw-up. i had this child, and it destroyed my family. it was a situation where i couldn't even blame anybody else but myself, because my wife was a fantastic wife. she was a great friend, she was a great adviser, everything, great mother. i mean, my kids were fantastic. the thing that i cherished the most, you know, i destroyed by some stupid things that i've done.
so now it's--you know, for me it's important to kind of rebuild again, get the trust back with the kids, with my wife, hopefully get back together again, bring the family back together again.
 when you were running for governor, there were all these rumors that you had been very flirtatious on the set. you've pretty much confirmed that there have been other instances. weren't you worried that some of this might come out?
  no.
 why?
  well, first of all, the stories that were out there weren't based on any truth at all. you know, the groping charges, all that. that was all nonsense. i think it was politically motivated. they came out three days before the election. i think the people looked through that very quickly.
but, you know, i'm--i'm ashamed about that past, the mistakes that i've made, because it was--you know, it wasn't one of the things were you make a mistake in bodybuilding, choosing the wrong movie or something, were you hurt your own career.
in this particular occasion, i've hurt a lot of people. i hurt my wife tremendously, who doesn't deserve that, and my kids and relatives, all this. i'm embarrassed, ashamed about it, but you can't go back.
the book--people said, why would you put this in the book? i said because i'm not going to write a book that just shows the success of arnold, the great immigrant story, but it is a great immigrant story, the book. but it also is a book about my failures, the bad decisions that i've made, the problems that i've caused because of it, all that, and it also has the successes in there. it's a book about the extraordinary immigrant story, but also with its faults.
 is there a happy ending potentially in this? in other words, do you get back together? does this become a hollywood movie inasmuch as, you know, this turns around? without getting too much into your personal life, where does this end?
  well, you know, i'm the forever optimist. so i do see that maria and i get together eventually. you know, it takes a lot of time to heal those wounds and to trust each other again. but, you know, i will make every effort.
maria has been extraordinary throughout this whole process. extraordinary also with bringing the children together and making sure that we celebrate together when there's a graduation or when there's a birthday or valentine's day or easter, or christmas, stuff like that. she's been great. the kids have been really great. i'm thankful about that.
 where do you stand at this moment? one interview you said she's not read the book yet.
  now she has the book, yes. i just got the copy last week, and she got the copyright away.
 did you give her a heads-up what's in it? did you tell her ahead of time?
  we talked about it, but i didn't go into details. i didn't get her to get into a situation where she knows about the book and she has to answer questions to the press. this way, officially she hasn't read it yet, and now she has the book.
 i remember going out, interviewing you a number of times while you were running for governor. i remember going out especially in the time when you were putting referendums that would have fundamentally transformed california.
california is now on the verge of bankruptcy, not unlike the united states, not unlike greece, spain, europe in general. it seems when people are given the choice of, well, government programs or cutting, they hang on to what they know, or what they have. but ultimately it's leading to a very dangerous path, i think, financially.
  well, i think that california has had a history of always spending more money than it takes in. i think ronald reagan went through that big challenge. as you remember, when he became governor, he had to raise taxes, he had to figure out how to make the severe cuts that he did.
ten years later, another republican governor had to raise taxes, went through the same problem. 10 years after that, pete wilson became governor, another republican, he had to raise taxes. 10 years later, i had to raise taxes.
i was like, i hated it. despised it. said, "arnold, how can you do that? you promised the people you would not raise taxes." all of a sudden there you are there with a $40 billion deficit because the economy took a dive and all of a sudden we had $22 billion less revenues coming in.
 even the car tax.
  exactly. it's a real dilemma and real challenge. it's one of the things that i, for instance, regret. we have accomplished a lot of things when i was governor. but the thing that i was adamant about solving was the financial problem of california to pay down the debt, number one. number two, to make the deficit go away and to live within our means. i was not able to do it.
(end videotape)
 we have much more with governor schwarzenegger. is he supporting a candidate this election? that is coming up next.
(commercial break)
 we continue now with arnold schwarzenegger. he's written a new memoir. it's called "total recall: my unbelievably true life story."
(begin videotape)
 you talk about in your book, you go through a childhood where you grew up, where you had to walk to get water.
  milk.
 milk. you didn't have a bathroom. you didn't have running water. you didn't have any of the bare necessities.
  right.
 but you survived as a family. you talked about a tough childhood with your father. he would come home once a week intoxicated, be pretty tough on the whole family. but here we are in a country, do you think at this time in america, one in six americans in poverty, 49 million americans needing foods stamps, something's really wrong, right?
  well, i think the important thing is that we get our world economy back again, and the united states gets our economy back again. as i said earlier, just alone, if you build the infrastructure, it's directly related to our gdp. if we spend two percent of our gdp on infrastructure, you will get an increase of our gdp annually of two percent. china spends 10 percent of their gdp in infrastructure and they have an increase of 10 percent economic activities, india it's seven percent, so it's directly related. it's short-sighted for us not to spend money on infrastructure. sadly the last money meant to be for economic recovery, only $150 billion went to infrastructure, the rest was sprinkled all around. it's very tough. both of the parties have to get together.
 how do they get together?
  they have to solve the problems because it's their responsibility. we sent them to washington to solve problems, not to --
 let me ask you this. one party that is just--borrowing 40 cents of every dollar. every time you talk about, for example, fixing medicare, which is going bankrupt. we get an ad, granny's being thrown off the cliff, right?
every time republicans say we've got to manage money with the epa, the president will say the republicans want dirty air and water. they don't care about kids with autism and down's syndrome. that's the narrative going on in this election.
  it's arguing and finger-pointing, because we're close to an election, which i understand is a close election. as soon as the election's over, they have the responsibility to get back together and solve the problems rather than saying, we can't touch that, because in two years from now there's another election coming up.
that's been the worst thing. i just think they're not living up to their responsibility. and the people of america should really be outraged about that, that nothing is getting done, and it's getting more and more polarized.
 it's still in your blood, i can see it. you don't get politics out of your system.
  no, no. look, it's politics, but for me i never really liked politics, but being a public servant. i think it's the greatest thing. my father-in-law talked about being a public servant is the ultimate kind of service, the ultimate job that you can have.
he was absolutely correct because to me there was nothing more satisfying than to be in sacramento, to solve problems, work with everyone together, bring everyone together, and to just chip away, keep solving problems, and serve the people.
because as an immigrant, as an immigrant, it is especially very satisfying that you can give something back to this country. you know, to be able to say thank you, to a place that's received you with open arms, and where i saw firsthand that the harder i worked, the more i accomplished, the more i achieved and there was no obstacle there. there was no--not like in europe, when i grew up, where there were obstacles after obstacles for you to get successful. here there was no obstacle. everyone wished you good luck and everyone said, yes, you can do it.
of course, with my outrageous dreams that i had, i even found people in america that said, no, that's impossible, arnold, when i said i want to be a leading man in the movies, i want to become governor, stuff like that. they say, no, no, this is impossible. but in this country, you can do it. this is the land of opportunity.
 do you think enough--do you think enough people in america have that mind-set or understanding? i think we've lost some of that.
  i think people are proud. i think americans are very patriotic. i think they love their country. but i think there's a lot of americans right now that are upset and that feel like the country's going in the wrong direction, that our politicians are going in the wrong direction.
and they wish that the politicians can get along. i remember that when i became governor, the parties in california were fighting so much that when i ran into this one--the father of a firefighter that just passed away, i went to the funeral, and i said to him, if you need anything, just let me know. he said, please, governor, when you get to sacramento, go and get along, bring the parties together. if you want to do anything for my son that passed away during a firefight, do that, bring the parties together.
i will always remember that, that that's the way the california people felt. it was not so important that the republican wins his way or democrat gets all his way. bring them together and solve the problems.
 you're kind of staying out of this presidential race.
  that's right, yes.
 why?
  i really wanted to see the debates, i always wait for the debates. there are always some people--for instance, mccain. i had a great relationship with mccain. he came out to fight for me in 2003, in 2005, in 2006, and he was campaigning up and down. so of course, when he ran for president, i was the first one to jump and to say i'm going to endorse him. it was a no-brainer. the same was with george bush. when he ran, he did great work for us. we had a great relationship, the things he did for california. how quickly he was out there with our fires, how quickly he responded, all the needs that we had. and of course, i endorsed him right away, even though we didn't agree on everything, but he was my man.
so some other times you just figure, like, i got to wait a little bit, i want to hear the debates, i'm going to really look forward to the debates, then i make up my mind. that's where i am right now with this whole thing.
 "total recall." governor, good to see you. all the best to you and your family.
  thank you very much. thank you. good to see you again.

 we have now with us governor arnold schwarzenegger from california. he just touched down in fresno. governor, thanks for making time for us today.    absolutely. how are you today rush? never better, sir. it is nice to have you.    terrific.  it's nice to speak with you.    it's nice to talk to you. the last time i think i saw you was at a fund-raiser for cancer research.  yeah, prostate cancer research.    you were seated next to my wife.  right, it was michael milken's thing. it was at the bellagio.    that's right, exactly, where they raised millions of dollars for cancer research. it was just a terrific event.  played a lot of golf that weekend, too, out at shadow creek.    right. so if we don't meet at the smoke-out, we meet at the cancer research fund-raiser so here we are, and here we are talking today. first of all i want to just say thank you for covering me yesterday after, you know, what i said about you. you explained exactly what i meant. i really appreciate that.  you mean the "irrelevant" comment?    exactly.  well, i know you, and i knew... see, i think you just probably get a little flustered. every time you go on these shows they throw my name up at you, and my interpretation was that you're governing california. i don't live there, and you're going to do what you're going to do regardless what anybody says.    well, i think that the point also is when you have a radio show or a tv show or you write papers, and you write your editorials and all this stuff, your objectives are different than mine. you know, i have to, ultimately, make decisions that are based on bringing people together, bringing democrats and republicans together, and to really working for the people and trying to resolve issues. if it is issues that have to do with health care or environment, if it is creating more jobs, getting more businesses to california, all of those things, i have to make tough decisions every day--or prison reform, and so i'm building more prisons. so all of those things. so what you guys are talking about and the ideology and philosophy and, you know, the right versus the left and all of those things, i cannot deal with that as much because to me what is important is that i bring both of the parties together and make things work to serve the people. this is what i do, and this is why i pay very little attention if someone criticizes me or calls me, you know, that i'm turning left and that i'm selling out or whatever. i have to stay focused on results.  well, we're doing the same thing. i react the same way to criticism as you do. i ignore it because there's too much of it. it's part of the territory. i'm all for bringing people together but not compromising principles in the process--and, you know, one of the reasons they keep throwing my name at you is because i have said that your compromise looks more like agreeing with liberals than maintaining your natural conservative beliefs.    well, i mean, you know, like i said: this is your interpretation, but the fact of the matter is that we are moving as a state forward exactly what my plan is. you know, when we last year--you know, you maybe disagree with that but--we increased the minimum wage by $1.25 and i think the people of california, the hard-working people of california, deserved that because for years they didn't have a minimum wage increase. so we did it in a way that it is doable for businesses but we also did it in a way where we did not go as far as the democrats wanted to go where they asked for a $2.50 increase and to have an automatic escalator in there and so on. so we didn't go there. so we compromised, and did something that i felt very comfortable with and thought that it was important. but the same thing again is with health care. you know, some people want to go and have health care and reform the system, so we have a government-run health care system. well, i disagree with that. i think that the private sector can take care of it, that we just need to create some guidelines of what it ought to be so that everyone is ensured, that insurance companies cover everyone, and to create a pool--a risk pool, a risk pool for insurance companies and to make it a partnership within the private sector, hospitals, doctors, the state and the federal government. and i was very happy that the federal government agreed to come in with $3.7 billion and help us with our health care reform. so those are the bottom lines. so it's not "selling out." it is just doing the work for the people because 72% of the people in the last poll said that our health care system is broken and yes, we need to fix it, and 82% of the people said that it needs to be fixed in the way where there's a shared responsibility, where everyone comes in and works. so those, i don't see them as selling out but i can understand from where you're coming from, where you look at it just the ideology or maybe in just a more conservative way. we are a state that is in a majority of democrats, and i have always said during the election process--during the i was running for governor three years ago--i said, "when i become governor i will be the people's governor and i will represent everybody, democrats and republicans."  well, look i'm not looking at it ideologically. you and i both want the same things: we want what's best for people.    right.  but ideology is a fundamental argument in that. i believe conservatism is the best way to provide the most opportunity and success for the vast majority of people. government simply can't do it. you mentioned the minimum wage and compromising. you compromised on the price, but you still accepted the premise of liberalism that minimum wage is a somehow going to improve people's lot in life, and it doesn't. you mentioned health care.    let me just say to you something, that i have had many, many--i would say hundreds of--hard-working people in california come up to me and say it did improve their life. so, i mean, i think it is wrong to say that it didn't improve people's lives. i think those things do improve people's lives. if you create health care for people, it does improve people's lives. if you go and create accountability in education, it does improve education. so i think i'm a results-oriented person, and i personally believed 100% that we need to raise the minimum wage that the people deserve it. so it was not like selling out or going the other way. it is something that i believe in, but, i stuck to my principles of not doing it to chase the businesses out of the state because i'm very proud of the fact that since i came into office-- have you reversed that trend of businesses and people leaving california?    yes.  they were leaving that state in droves, and that was one of your campaign promises, or premises, after the gray davis recall, that there were way too many businesses fleeing the state.    rush, i just give you an example. i give you an example.  high taxation, a number of things, regulation forcing people out.    (chuckles.) i give you an example that made me, actually, very happy. the other day we were at an event where a drywalling company--a manufacturing company that produces drywalls--has moved their operation to california, and it is the biggest one in the world, and they came here because they said, "this is a great business environment." they can do business here. they can be part of the great growth and the success of california, and said they're moving their workers and creating this huge business right here in california. that's just one out of many, many examples where businesses are feeling now, again very, very happy about coming to california. that doesn't mean that other businesses don't think about going to another state, but i would say a huge amount of businesses are coming back here because we are creating a much better business atmosphere--and remember one thing, and i know this is something that you love, and that is giving money back to our private sector, to people. when we reformed workers' compensation, that has created now an additional increase in money for the private sector of $13 billion a year. now, think about how much money this is. now, when we go into health care reform, as you know right now--and this is the important thing for the conservatives to think about, that right now--everyone that is insured here in california, they are paying for the uninsured. that means there's a hidden tax there, a huge hidden tax--so much that the private sector businesses in california are paying $14.billion right now in the hidden tax. what i want to do is get rid of that hidden tax; reduce the cost of health care through prevention and through insuring everyone and make sure that everyone carries insurance and that everyone is insured by the insurance companies. so this is the kinds of things that we are doing.  now, wait a second. you want to extend health care coverage to every child even the children of illegal aliens, immigrants in the country, and you want to raise taxes to do this, and you call them "loans."    well, rush, i just said that we're reducing the hidden tax of $14.7 billion. we want to get rid of this hidden tax that is being made right now.  but a tax is a tax.    billions--every single-- but if you replace the hidden tax with visible tax, it's still a tax.    no. hold on a second. every single person that is insured right now, is paying extra money. if it's the premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, copays, all of those things is more money because of the hidden tax because every time you get insurance, you pay for those that are uninsured--and that is unfair to those people that are insured. so what we want to do is insure everybody, and make it mandatory that each person has to carry insurance so we get rid of that hidden tax that is existing right now, and this is why when we talk about the 4% increase, it's not really a tax. it is a fee, because actually in the end those companies and individuals will profit by the lowering of our health care costs and getting rid of the hidden tax. so it's a wash, or it actually they come out much more ahead than they are now.  governor, you were so good during your first campaign, and you had the whole country inspired. you were so good at the 2004 republican convention, and you had people in california particularly, inspired and motivated.    well, thank you. 
 but they see a lot--(laughing.)    (laughing.) thank you.  but they see a lot of about-faces.    what?  for example, in 2005, you vetoed a democrat bill that would have expanded the state's health care coverage to children because the $300 million price tag was too high. now you've turned around and your health care plan is being applauded by the state's democrats.    no. you're absolutely wrong, rush. because i vetoed the bill to cover every child because they did not set up a revenue stream that shows where the money will come from. we are a state that is still paying off our debt. anyone that sends me a bill that costs more money, i will veto it because it is not right until we pay off our debt. this is why i want to have a comprehensive health care reform where we know where the money comes from, that we create a pool of $12 billion where the state and the federal government comes in and helps us with that, and it is a shared responsibility, and that will cover everyone. now, let me go back to your question that you had earlier about undocumented immigrants. undocumented immigrants right now get health care and get coverage. they can go to any emergency in the united states.  i know.    any emergency room in california, because that's the federal law.  right, and many of them in southern california--   rush----closed down because they're not being paid for the visits by these people.    but listen, rush. it is not a question should we cover them or not. they are covered. it is illegal to turn anyone away from any emergency room.  that's for emergency health care, though, governor.   --and therefore in my health care reform, we are debating not, "should they be covered or not?" but it is a debate, "how it can be done cheaper and more cost effectively?" that's what we are going to work out. it's one-fifth of the cost that we are paying right now, which is a great benefit to the taxpayer.  but emergency room coverage is emergency coverage. what you are proposing is universal, all over the place all the time.    you know when you don't go to an emergency room, do you know that 90% of the time there's no emergency? if they would have a health clinic or some kind of a medical clinic they can go get those things done for $50 rather than paying a thousand dollars--what they're doing right now-- well, they're not paying the thousand.   --in the emergency rooms, and it crowds up the emergency rooms, and therefore people has to wait five to seven hours. so, i mean, believe me: we are moving forward. the important thing you need to know is, that 91% of the votes from republicans in the last election, which was just two months or three months ago: 91%. i won with a 17% lead over my opponent. so i have a lot of republicans on my side, and they understand that i want to get the job done rather than fighting like they do in washington over nothing-- well, i don't--  --fighting over who is right and who is wrong and nothing gets done. imagine that for years now we are debating over immigration reform, and they can't get their act together. that is embarrassing. i think that those guys should sit down and be serious about it, forget a little bit about their ideology and get things done and represent the people of california and the people of america. i think that's what the bottom line is.  the problem with that is the liberals and the democrats are not going to punt their ideology because it defines them, and so when we end up agreeing with them just to get compromise, even if the numbers they want are not as much as they wanted, we are still compromising our ideology, they are not--and this is what people are upset about. it's happening in washington.    rush? rush?  it's happening in california.    i happen to disagree with that, rush, because i think that they should not get stuck-- you know liberals, governor. you've been around them your whole career! you know who they are. you know that they don't waive--   i understand it, but i'm just saying that in the end, we have to represent the people and do the job for the people, and that sometimes takes compromise and there's nothing wrong with that, and you still can speak to your ideology, and stay with that, but you still have to compromise in order to get things done, and that's their job in washington--to get things done and to represent the people and to do a great job and to fix things, to fix health care, to fix immigration reform--not to argue year after year after year and to make promises that they can't keep. so anyway, so you and i, we're going to have a good time again on our next smoke out that we're going to have?  (laughing.)    we'll smoke a stogie together and we'll be talking about this from here to eternity. the key thing is that people should know that you and i, we don't have a fight. we don't argue over those things. we just have different opinions, and, you know, and i am enjoying that because i think the republican party has a big tent.  governor, look, i've always liked you, and i've always admired you. the first time i met you at that planet hollywood opening in dallas, i had a great time. we've all got so much hope for you. everybody wants you to be who you are. i know there are a lot of republicans--and it was in the paper today--hoping you wake up one day and become a conservative again.    right, right. (laughing.)  i'm sure you saw that. look it, i appreciate your calling.    thank you!  i appreciated the time and i'll see you at the grand havana club next time.    you got it!  all right. take care.    bye-bye. thank you.  governor arnold schwarzenegger.

what is your training like these days?
 i do circuit training now. five or six exercises in a row, higher reps, no rest. i just want to keep my muscles stimulated and firm. i start with cardio. ill do 10 minutes on the exercise bike and then do the circuit. then ill do another 10 minutes and do another circuit, and so on. ill do five rounds. the exercises change from one workout to the next to use the shocking method. i might do one or two exercises per body part. i might do a pulldown, then a calf exercise, then a chest exercise, then a bentover row. sometimes ill do 10 reps or 30 or 40 reps per exercise.

how has the fitness industry changed over the years?

 its improved considerably. thirty years ago, i could be traveling for a movie and be in a hotel and there would be no gym. so i had to bring my own workout trailer. today, nearly every hotel has a workout facility, or theres a place right around the corner. the availability of the equipment is much better.

what is the strangest thing you've ever seen in a gym?

 i managed a gym in munich that had a cigarette machine and a huge amount of beer mugs. this was 45 years ago, and nobody talked about how smoking was bad for you.

what was your all-time best bench press?

 520. i was 20 and weighed 245.

youre passionate about fitness but also cigars. how do you square the two?

 i have never promoted cigar smoking. i enjoy cigars but i only smoke one to three cigars a week. i used to smoke more but then i cut it way down. when people ask me, what kind of an example are you? [with regard to cigars], i say, i dont want to be an example for that. i want to be an example for living a healthy lifestyle and exercising every day, being motivated, and going after things. but i dont want to be an example for non smoking or wearing a helmet when you ride a bike. let somebody else do that. when i was governor, people told me i should be a perfect example, but thats what makes politicians fake. they wear a blue blazer and a red tie and dont smoke but thats not really them. i never wanted to be a fake. i smoked cigars in a tent right in the capital building. then people know who i am-they know im not pretending.

what do you think the future of bodybuilding is?

 i think that eventually well become an olympic sport. it will continue to grow. we promote it as a means to ultimate fitness. its not only a competitive sport, you can use bodybuilding for rehab, improving performance at sports, slowing the aging process, looking better, and having a quality life. our only downside is the drug issue.

when was the last time you drank a coke?

 im not into coke. i probably havent had one in 25 years. im from europe and we drank mostly water or beer. i never got into the soda thing.

what is your favorite of your own movies?

 the terminator movies, true lies, twins, predator. those are classics now.

what do you think your worst movie was?

 hercules in new york. theres this battle over waterboarding at places like guantanamo bay. i think that they should just say, hey, if you guys dont talk, you have to see hercules in new york. i guarantee those guys would talk much faster. you dont need to do waterboarding or anything else. thats the ultimate threat.

has your competitiveness diminished at all with age, or are you still hungry?

 it has toned down a little bit. when i was young i wanted to be the king of the world. today i would be happy with just being president.

what is the strangest request you ever got from a fan?

 to run away and get married. but he wasn't my type. he was a little too tall.

what will set your book [out in october] apart from all the other biographies on you?

 i want to take the readers on that ride. that journey that i have taken. they will get the feeling of what it's like to grow up in austria after the dreams of the third reich have been shattered. to grow up in an environment where people feel like losers. and then to make it out of there and become the world champion of bodybuilding. i'll take them through what working out in austria was like, how i developed the drive and the will and the fire in my belly. then to the united states and not speaking the language and being told i would never make it as an actor. then what it's like to go to camp david with president bush, and sit in the oval office, and marry into a family like the kennedys, and then become governor. i also want to make people understand the conflicting mentalities i had. i had the austrian mentality and then i adopted the american mentality and there was a fight between them. then i'll talk about how milton berle taught me stand-up and to tell jokes. i tried for years to stay away from it because i was never inspired to do an autobiography, but after the governorship i thought there was enough good material that will make the book truly unique.

what is the hardest thing in life?

 to have a vision. people really struggle with that the most. i think that if you have a vision, everything is easier in life. if you see yourself doing certain things, it's easier to work your way up that ladder because you know which ladder to climb. once you know what you want to do, the how-to material is out there. i was lucky to be born as a person who always had very clear vision. it's hard for me to explain it to people. vision makes you able to go through pain, crying, and ups and downs, because you know what it is for and where you're going toward.

there are a lot of prank phone calls on the internet that use lines from your movies. how do you feel about them?

 i think they're hilarious and creative, and i wouldn't want to be on the other end of those calls. you hear some innocent girl answer the phone in some shop and say, can i help you? and then all of a sudden you hear a voice say, this is john kimble. who is your daddy and what does he do? and then she says, my daddy is working as a driver. then it's, answer the question! and she says, but i did. who is this? and i say, it's john kimble. i'm asking the questions. the people get so flustered [laughs]. i laugh many times when i listen to those. it's very entertaining.

 what's the story with your carbohydrate back-loading? daniel was telling me about it and i didn't understand it. he's a fanatic workout guy so he knows all the latest terminology that appears on the internet. he told me about the carb back-load thing.

yeah, the idea is just to not eat carbs in the early part of the day, and then after you train, load up on carbs. at that point, if you train in the afternoon or evening, you can get away with a lot more so-called bad foods than you could if you eat them in the morning because your muscles are more sensitive to absorbing carbs at night after you train.

 what do you mean they're much more sensitive? you mean they don't absorb as many carbohydrates at night?

they actually absorb them better. if you eat carbs earlier in the day, like if you have a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, the way the hormones in the body work, you're more apt to store more body fat from those carbs earlier in the day. but if you wait till later in the day, like four to six p.m., and then do some heavy weight training and then eat your carbs, they'll more likely be shuttled to the muscles and then they won't be stored as fat. cortisol levels come down over the course of the day and your insulin sensitivity is higher after training. so it's a good way if you want to have more of a relaxed diet and eat more junk foods and foods you like and not be so strict. if you can time your carbs later in the day after your training, that's the way to do it.

 franco and i, the week before competition, used to go to the house of pies and eat pies at night. but we did not know what you just said. instinctively, we just felt like we needed the pie. other bodybuilders would say, you guys are crazy, it's going to smooth you out. you're going to fuck everything up with your diet and lose the competition. but after dieting, we couldn't even think straight. so we would go like an addicted couple and devour our pies just like animals. they were usually cherry pies. we'd be so happy walking out of there, like we had our fix. but it was always at night, like 8 or 9.

sounds like you invented carb back-loading and you didn't even know it!

 so many times we do things and now when you explain it maybe that's the reason why it didn't have the bad effect that everybody was worried about

what does maria think about you writing a memoir and bringing this up?

i think that maria is, you know, wishing me well with everything that i do.

has she read it?

 no. at this point, she hasn't read anything.

 but she knows you're discussing it?

 she knows that it's about my whole life and that i would not write a book and kind of leave out that part and make people feel like, "well, wait a minute. are we just getting a book about his success stories and not talk about his failures?" and that's not the book i wanted to write. i wanted to write a book about me. here's my life.
so what's his life been like since the scandal? well, he's not hiding. he's out there on the red carpet, promoting one of the five movies he's signed up to make.

 isn't that why you've gone back to the movies?

 no.

 to make money?

 no. i don't need money. i have enough money.

 well, you-- didn't you lose a lot of money when you became governor?

 even with my divorce and with everything, i don't need money. i have plenty of money, unlike other hollywood celebrities or athletes that have not invested well. when you read my book, you will see what a fanatic i am about the-- to turn one dollar into two. 

 this is not your new car!

 yeah, this is my new car.

 no!

it's called an unimog by mercedes.

 you gonna take me for a ride?

life with arnold can be fun. but as we now know with the scandal, it's been a double life.

 you know, i've spent time with you and you are so much fun and you have enormous charm. and i have to keep reminding myself about this chapter of your life. i do, i have to keep saying, "wow, he did something that speaks to character." do you have to remind yourself? or is it always there?

 it's always there.

until now - as he describes in "total recall" - arnold schwarzenegger's has been the ultimate immigrant success story.

his life began in austria, which he visits a couple of times a year. he was born in the small farming village of thal, in a house that is now the arnold schwarzenegger museum, typically over-the-top with a giant replica of arnold in his favorite pose.

 this was always the pose that closed the deal.

 there's exhibitionism in you.

 you know, so you show off what you have at any given time. so that's what i had then, and that's what i showed off, and i tell you, i showed off plenty of it.

he was born in 1947, two years after the end of world war ii. his house had no electricity, no plumbing, no running water.

 this is what, the kitchen?

 this is actually the room where everything took place. literally everything.

including sponge baths.

 we just pulled this out. and here, this would be filled up with water.

water from a well a quarter-mile away. everyone took turns, using the same basin of water. arnold, the youngest, always went last.

 same water?

 same water. by the time i got to wash myself, the water was black.

 there was never one single sentence said in the house about the war period. so the promise of hitler, that hitler gave them, that we're going to create the third reich, and we're going to build this fantastic place for you, and we will, you know, basically rule the world. all of that was gone and what was left was losers.

he says his father was bitter and he always had a troubled relationship with him.

 he was pretty tough on you.

 well, he was very tough. i mean, he--

 i mean, hit you.

 my father, you know, ran after me with a belt. and beat me with a belt. everything. everything you can think of. they got very creative.

he says his father's harshness drove him and motivated him to find something he could be good at. he began spending five hours a day lifting weights, and he converted his bedroom into a shrine to men with freakishly large muscles.

 my mother looked at that and she was just so depressed.

so she called in the family doctor.

 "i don't know if there's something wrong with my son because-- you know, look at this."

 'cause he likes naked men?

 "whole wall is full of naked men. doctor, can you help me? because all of arnold's friends, they have pictures of girls above their bed. and arnold has no girls, as you can see. no girls. and look at this picture over there with the naked-- with his thing sticking out." and then, the doctor--

 she thought you were gay.

 i don't know if she thought that i was gay, or if she just thought i was-- there was something off. and let's catch it early.

 we tried it out, we experimented with it.

 shots?

 tablets, shots. whatever was available then. this was in the era before the growth hormones and all this other stuff came in.

he also worked on the rest of his master plan: going to school at night and, early on, he invested what little savings he had in buying rundown properties in santa monica.

 and so i started investing in buildings up and down main street including this building. so very quickly i became a millionaire in my 20s already.

 they said, "arnold, trust me. today, it's dustin hoffman. he's a little guy. al pacino. he's a little guy. woody allen. those are the sex symbols. don't you understand it? don't you get it?"

 they thought, "this guy who can't speak english or had such a thick accent."

 that's right and with a name like schwarzen-schnitzel - what are you going to do with that name up there on the billboard? i heard all that, but i heard, of course: "yes."

 in your own little head?

 when they said "no," i heard, "yes, you can do it, arnold. you can do it."

he likes defying the odds, which he does with steely discipline and drive. he worked hard to become an actor, finding out in his acting lessons that the self-control he'd mastered as a bodybuilder was getting in his way.

 the thing that can really make you lose is if you get emotionally unbalanced, and if i put everything that's happening emotionally on deep freeze. so i became an expert in living in denial.

 someone said about you that one key to your success was your resolute, non-introspection. and you also say in the book, i think, that if you have had a failure in life, you just erase it. you don't think about it, and just keep going.

 i don't dwell on it. dwelling on it, like some people do, you know, years later, say, "oh, yeah, i lost this, and i will never forget that. i'm still suffering." no, that's not me. i don't suffer of anything that i've lost.

 you're able to just keep going?

 oh, yeah.

 you write in the book that you had an affair with the actress in that movie. you cheated on maria. and you were in your relationship. and you don't even write that you felt bad about it. you just write it.

 actually, you know, i did feel bad about it. but, i mean, all of my various different things, they were mistakes. and this is, you know, my failure. my screw-ups.

 was that the only affair?

 no. i had others. but i mean, ah, but you know, it's something that's obviously between maria and me.

 she knew?

 yeah.

 so it's a recurring issue with you.

 i'm not perfect.

 you had a health care initiative. and here's what you write in your book: "my plan improved on mitt romney's massachusetts plan by strengthening the individual mandate."

 that's right.

 this was obamacare before obamacare.

 forget obamacare. this is a principle that goes back hundreds of years. people need to be insured so when you have an accident out there, or when something catastrophic happens to you, that you're covered and there's not someone else has to pay for you. that is as simple as that. 

 when you told your doctor you weren't going to tell your wife, he - i mean, he couldn't believe it.

 and he says, "your wife is pregnant. what are you talking about you're not going to tell her." i said, "now here's the plan." i said, "i'm gonna have the heart surgery. you do it quietly. no one knows about it. we'll do it at six in the morning. and then four days later i'm outta here and i go down to mexico. and i'll tell maria, i'll tell maria, i'll say, "look i'm down here. little busy. and i'm on vacation." and when i come back i will be tanned. no one will know. he said, "arnold, are you outta your mind?" he said, "you're gonna have a big scar here on the chest. what do you mean your wife is not gonna see the scar?"

 but people are listening to you tell this story. and it's bizarre.

 very.

 what is it with you? i'm s-- i'm serious.

 i don't know. that's the way i handle things. and it always has worked. but, i mean it does not-- it's not the best thing for people around me because i sometimes-- some information i just keep to myself.

 once again, you don't tell your wife.

 that's right.

 she started shaking. and she had tears in her eyes. i realize that i was stepping into something that was much deeper than just me running and her being a supportive wife. 

 you had no idea that this was something she would not want to get back into?

 no. as a matter of fact, i was thinking that she would say, "wow, that is amazing, welcome to the club. we finally convinced you to be a public servant, just like my entire family." none of that. so all of a sudden it came to a grinding halt and i had to now deal with the drama. 

 maria wants to have a meeting with your marriage counselor. tell us about that meeting.

 that particular visit that you're talking about was the visit where she then said, "hey, i think that joseph is your kid. and, am i off here on this or-- or not?" and i said, "you're absolutely correct." and i had to face up to that, which i have been kind of hiding but no one knew about. and that i knew about at that point maybe for five, six years or so.

 you just said, "you're absolutely right"?

 i said, "you're absolutely right, and i am sorry." it was very painful for her. she was very disappointed.

 maria asked you, "why didn't you tell me?" and what did you say?

 that i did not know how to.

 you didn't know how to tell her?

 how to tell her without worrying about, you know, that it would get out or whatever.

 and that she'd leave you while you were still governor.

 i don't think that was as much of an issue as just how do i keep this under wraps.

 well, tell us how it happened. this is a woman who worked in your house--

 exactly. and i found out about it kind of-- seven years in or eight years in--

 well, wait, wait, wait. you-- wait. you have this relationship. nine months later she's-- has a baby. didn't you say, "oh my god, it's my baby?"

 no.

 you - it never crossed your mind?

 no, because she was with a man and she-- so no.

 so you have this relationship. and she keeps working in the house?

 uh-huh. (affirm)

 do you keep having the relationship?

 no. but, look, i have caused enough pain to everyone as it is, if it is my wife or my kids. so i don't want to reawaken and kind of talk about it because it's not going to help them. and i just want to protect them as much as i can.

 well, i understand that. but you wrote it.

 no, no, the things that i wrote about i don't mind telling you.

joseph was born almost the same time as maria and arnold's fourth child. a smiling maria celebrated joseph's christening, clearly unaware.

 was he around the house?

 i've seen him many times, yes.

 you said he played with your kids when he was little.

 that's right, yeah.

 so now he's seven or eight and you take a look? well, tell us--

 no, no. i was-- it just appeared to me there was something off, that he started looking like me. so that's when i kind of got it, that-- it was never discussed. but, i mean, i put the things together here.

 did you ask her? ask-- her name is mildred. did you ask mildred?

 no, i didn't. but i felt like that i should take on the responsibility of taking care of him and her. and so i started taking care of joseph financially and--

 well, all of a sudden she starts getting money? no, you must have said, "i know, i want to take care of him." you never--

 no.

 well, how does money start showing up?

 i gave it to her and she knew what it was about.

 did you think that if you gave her money, that she wouldn't talk, like hush money?

 i don't think that mildred was at all into talking. mildred is a good person. she was not out to get me or to take advantage.

 you write, "i wanted mildred to continue working in our home because i thought i could control the situation better that way." and i read that to mean that if she was in the house, you could make sure she wouldn't tell anybody.

 no. it was more that-- it will be the wrong thing to do, to let them go. and, not make her feel like she's being punished when i find out that this is my child.

 but she remained your housekeeper?

 that's right.

 even after you realized it?

 uh-huh (affirm).

 was that-- was that strange?

 very difficult, strange, i mean, bizarre, i mean, everything else. whatever you want to call it. but it's the best way i could handle it. and it was one of those things we talked about, you know, denial. i kind of put it away and just said to myself, "okay, i'm gonna put this away. i'm gonna fulfill my responsibilities."

 how can you put it away? you have a child.

 i know, but that's just the way i operate.

 when you ran for governor, there were charges, all kinds of charges of groping and grabbing women. and maria went up and down the state and vouched for you. do you think back on that time and say, "wow--

 well, i think that--

 --i got her to do that for me and then i did this to her?"

 no, i -- well, two different things. the charges of the groping and, you know, that whole vicious attack had nothing to do with mildred and had nothing to do with anything else.

 but she kept saying you were a good man. she vouched for your character.

 no, she vouched-- she says, "look. i know arnold. he doesn't do those things that you have read. and i am his wife, i know him better than that." you know, end of story.

 you write that maria did ask you before the confrontation with the marriage counselor. "is that your child?" before then. so you lied to her.

 you can say that.

 she gave up her television career for you. i mean, wow. was this just the most unbelievable act of betrayal to maria?

 i think it was the stupidest thing i've done in the whole relationship. it was terrible. i inflicted tremendous pain on maria and unbelievable pain on the kids.

 your children.

 and-- yeah, exactly. because i had to tell them each about the-- what has happened and how i have screwed up and--

 how did that go?

 --asked them for forgiveness. well, it-- they cried. i mean, it - it's like - it takes, you know, it tears your heart out, i mean when you just, you know, have to tell them that.

 are you now joseph's father? in other words, do you see him? do you do father things with him?

 i don't want to go and get into that. but the important thing you should know is, that everyone should know is, that i take care of him and i take care of her. and i fulfill my responsibility and i'm glad to do that.

 we've talked a lot about how you put your failures behind you by not looking back too much, by not being that introspective. are you just moving forward again now? just plow ahead?

 if you would have asked me 10 years ago, five years ago, two years ago, what is the most important thing in my life, i would tell you over and over, it's my marriage, it's my family. so the thing that really meant the most to me kinda fell apart because of my doing. that is something that i will always look back and say, "how could you have done that?"

twenty-five years ago this week, i became a united states citizen. i will always remember sept. 16, 1983, as one of the greatest days of my life.
like other newcomers to this country, i came here for my shot at the american dream. growing up in a small village in austria, where if i worked hard i might be fortunate enough to follow in my father's footsteps and become a policeman, i knew america was the promised land. it was the place to go if you wanted your dreams to come true.
with hard work and determination, and because the american people were so generous and welcoming, i have succeeded beyond my wildest imagination.
i understand the immigrant yearning for freedom and opportunity. but i also believe immigrants have a responsibility to america as well. it is not enough to come here and take the best this nation has to offer without giving something back. to truly succeed as an american citizen, you have to do more.
first, learn the english language and blend into the american culture, even as you honor and remain proud of your own heritage. i don't say learn the language out of any sense of etiquette or duty. do it so you can participate fully in the life of the nation and make the most of living in this country.
i came here in 1968 speaking only a little english. to make it in business and hollywood, i knew i had to take english lessons, speech lessons, accent removal lessons, anything to improve my chances of success. and i happily did it all.

second, participate in the political process. in austria, i was surrounded by countries like hungary, czechoslovakia, and yugoslavia where citizens did not have the right to vote. so i have always been keenly aware that this right should not be taken for granted. but too many americans do.

democracy is not a spectator sport. to keep it strong and to effect real change, you have to be involved. learn about some of the sacrifices americans have made over the years to build and preserve the greatest democracy in history. hundreds of thousands of americans have died defending freedom. if you visit just one civil war battlefield or learn about world war ii, it's hard to take for granted the right to vote.

finally, give something back. many immigrants come from cultures where service is not stressed. i was no different. in fact, it was not until i met my wife, maria, and her parents, sargent and eunice kennedy shriver, that i discovered the true value of service.

they started so many programs that helped millions of people, from special olympics to the peace corps, job corps, and head start. before i knew it, i was spending time with kids from the special olympics. that made me feel so good, i was soon working in after-school programs to give kids safe choices when the bell rang at the end of the day. i became chairman of the president's council on fitness and sports and traveled around the nation talking to students about staying healthy by exercising and eating right.

i had the ultimate opportunity to give something back to california when i was elected governor in 2003. to promote service around our state and nation, i created the first cabinet-level position for service and volunteering, calling on the next president and other governors to do the same.

there are so many great immigrants who have performed outstanding public service for this nation that i could fill this entire column with a list of their names. madeleine albright and henry kissinger became great secretaries of state. andrew grove built intel into a high-tech powerhouse. max frankel moved to america from germany and went on to run the new york times . albert einstein also came here from germany. the list goes on and on.

these were immigrants who came here for the american dream, but they were not looking for handouts. they did not ask only what they could get from their new country. they also asked what they could give to it.

not everyone can become albert einstein, but as martin luther king jr. said, "anybody can be great, because anybody can serve."

pitch in a few hours every week at a soup kitchen, clean up a local park or riverbed, mentor a child, or coach a youth sports team. give something back, and not only will you lift up others, but you will lift yourself up, too. when you do these things, you will learn what i learned when i became a citizen: once you're in, other than being able to run for president, you have all the same rights as descendants of those who came here on the mayflower.

there is no second-tier citizenship. you are an american, period. with hard work, learning english, and getting involved, there is no limit on what you can achieve.

i want to begin with a true story from which we can draw a worthwhile lesson.
as you might guess, the schwarzenegger household is something of a menagerie.
an austrian bodybuilder, a tv journalist, four children, a dog, the normal goldfish and hamsters and so forth--and in recent years we added a miniature pony and a pot-bellied pig.
it's not unusual for me to look up from working on the budget or something to find a pig and a pony standing there staring at me.
now, the dog's food, which we keep in a canister with a screw-on lid, sits on the top of the dog's kennel.
the pony has learned to knock the canister off the top of the kennel, and then he and the pig wedge it into the corner.
there's this ridge on the lid of the canister, and the pig with his snout pushes this ridge around and around until it loosens, and then they roll the canister around on the floor until the food spills out.
i don't know how they ever figured all of that out.
it's like humans figuring out how to create fire.
but it is the greatest example of teamwork. i love it.
so one lesson to draw from the pig and the pony story is what we can accomplish when we work together.
and last year we here in this room did some great things working together.
we had a pig and pony year.
now before some reporter writes that i compared the legislature to a pig or a pony, that is not the message at all.
together, as a team--as fractious, tentative and uncertain as it might have been--together, we got california through the front end of the worst financial crisis since the great depression.
although not without pain, we closed a budget gap of 60 billion dollars!
these decisions were very hard for both sides of the aisle.
on the republican side, we had leaders who sacrificed their careers or put them at risk.
on the democratic side, we had legislators who were threatened by their own interest groups.
to those on both sides of the aisle who took these risks for the good of the state, you have my deepest admiration.
we did what we had to do.
we made painful spending cuts. we passed temporary tax increases. we permanently eliminated colas for most state programs.
we made major reforms in welfare and parole.
and there are two accomplishments in particular i want to recognize.
just last night the assembly passed major educational reform, reform that once seemed impossible, but now will become law as soon as it hits my desk.
for too many years, too many children were trapped in low-performing schools.
the exit doors may as well have been chained.
now, for the first time, parents--without the principal's permission--have the right to free their children from these destructive schools.
that is a great freedom.
also in the past, parents had no power to bring about change in their children's schools.
but that will now change.
parents will now have the means to get rid of incompetent principals and take other necessary steps to improve their children's education.
to increase accountability, we broke down the firewall so that teacher performance can be linked to student performance.
another major accomplishment: for decades this state was in a literal war over water, with old and deep divisions, northern california versus southern california, democrat versus republican, farmer versus environmentalist, business versus labor.
we here in this room made history with the most comprehensive water package in nearly half a century.
working together, we got it done.
and now we must work to pass the 11 billion dollars in water bonds that will be on the ballot in november.
some people say... how can we afford these bonds in the current economic climate?
i say, how can we not?
it is the law that you cannot build a school; you cannot build a factory; you cannot build an office building or a housing development without identifying a source of water.
as a result, huge projects with thousands of jobs have been put on hold.
our economy cannot grow without water. our population cannot live without water. it is our state's lifeblood.
now is exactly the time to invest in it, so that when californians turn on the faucet, there is safe, reliable and clean water coming out the tap--not just five years from now but 30, 40 or 50 years.
now, the coming year.
if i had to summarize in one word our focus for the coming year, it would be the word "priorities."
we have to get them straight and we have to keep them straight.
the first priority for the coming year is the economy and jobs.
the people and businesses of california are an engine of self-betterment and progress.
as long as government keeps the engine oiled with prudent policies--and more importantly--does not pour sand in its gears, this state will persevere and prosper.
i will come to the main thing we can do to help the economy in a moment, but there are four proposals to spur job growth that i will introduce.
first, you will receive a $500 million jobs package that we estimate could train up to 140,000 workers and help create 100,000 jobs.
second, you will receive a measure to streamline the permitting of construction projects that already have a completed environmental report.
third, to stimulate other construction jobs, you will receive a proposal for homebuyer tax credits of up to $10,000 for the purchase of new or existing homes.
and fourth, since we want california to be the dynamo of green technology, i ask you to pass our proposal exempting the purchase of green tech manufacturing equipment from the sales tax.
that, too, means jobs--jobs for the new economy.
while we still have a long way to go, the worst is over for california's economy.
and the really good thing is that we have the right economic mix going forward--high tech, green tech, bio-tech, hollywood-tech, farmer-tech and so forth.
our economy is well-positioned to take advantage of the future.
so let me tell you the main thing that we here in this chamber can do to help the economy and jobs. we can be a better partner to the economy. to strengthen the economy, which is the foundation of all jobs, we here in this chamber must reform california's budget and tax system. that would be a huge stimulus.
the basic problem is that our tax system does not reflect our economy.
in 2009, california's economic growth declined 2.8%...but our tax revenues were down more than 8 times that much.
our economy is diverse, whereas our tax system is not.
144,000 taxpayers pay almost 50 percent of all personal income taxes.
think about it. 38 million californians have to rely on 144,000 people for their schools, their fire protection, their health care, their public safety and many other services.
that makes no sense.
here is what we need to accept: our economy is 21st century, but our tax system is 20th century.
it's stuck in the wrong century.
the tax reform commission did its work and came up with a plan for reform that was praised by both willie brown and the wall street journal.
how often does that happen?
the commission proposed major, radical reforms.
some people say they are too bold and thus they would be too hard to enact.
what do they mean too bold?
bold is what we do in california.
what do they mean too hard? if i had hesitated to attempt something because it was too hard, i'd still be yodeling in austria.
we must begin work on these tax reforms because we simply cannot wait for the rich to bounce back.
state revenues are not expected to return to where they were until 2013 to 2014.
i sent you the tax reform commission's plan in late september, but it seems to have disappeared somewhere under this dome.
where is it? maybe the pig and the pony have taken it.
but i am looking forward to working with the legislature to get this done.
budget reform is just as important.
the budget crisis is our katrina. we knew it was coming. we've known it for years. and yet sacramento would not reinforce the economic levees.
in addition to taking action on the commission's plan, i ask you to also take action on the best practices budget accountability act, which has been drafted by the reform group, california forward.
i especially support its proposals for performance-based budgeting and applying one-time spikes in revenues to one-time uses, such as debt reduction, infrastructure and the rainy day fund.
the leaders of this body have said that the legislature should be given a chance to enact reforms before reforms go directly to the people.
here is that chance. i urge you to take it.
and as we struggle to overcome our differences, what i ask you to remember is that the current tax and budget system is cruel.
it is cruel because it is forcing us to make a sophie's choice among our obligations.
which child do we cut? the poor one? the sick one? the uneducated one? the one with special needs?
that is cruel.
we overcame the divisions on water. we can do it on the tax system and budget systems. i will address our immediate budget situation more fully in a few days, but let me give you an overview.
we face a $19.9 billion deficit--$6.6 billion for the rest of this budget year and $13.3 billion for the upcoming budget year.
big picture, let me tell you what will be required.
first, as bitter as the words are in my mouth, we face additional cuts.
we know what that means.
we know the pain it entails.
what can we say at this point except the truth? that we have no choice.
but i am drawing this line. because our future economic well-being is so dependent upon education, i will protect education funding in this budget.
and we can no longer afford to cut higher education either.
the priorities have become out of whack over the years.
thirty years ago 10 percent of the general fund went to higher education and 3 percent went to prisons.
today almost 11 percent goes to prisons and only 7 1/2 percent goes to higher education.
spending 45 percent more on prisons than universities is no way to proceed into the future.
what does it say about a state that focuses more on prison uniforms than caps and gowns?
it simply is not healthy.
i will submit to you a constitutional amendment so that never again do we spend a greater percentage of our money on prisons than on higher education.
the way we get this done is to find more cost-effective ways to run our prison system and allows private prisons to compete with public prisons. competition and choice are always good.
california spends $50,000 per prisoner.
by comparison, the ten largest states spend $32,000.
they spend less, and yet you do not see federal judges taking over their prison health care.
why do we have to spend so much more than they do?
if california's prisons were privately run, it would save us billions of dollars a year.
that's billions of dollars that could go back to higher education where it belongs and where it better serves our future.
choosing universities over prisons: this is a historic and transforming realignment of california's priorities.
if you have two states and one spends more on educating and one spends more on incarcerating, in which state's economy would you invest?
i ask you to make the right choice for california.
another major item is this: federal funds have to be part of our budget solution because the federal government is part of our budget problem.
when president clinton was in office, california got back 94 cents on the dollar from the federal government. today we get only 78 cents back.
texas gets 94 cents. pennsylvania gets $1.07. alaska, with all its oil, gets back $1.84 for every dollar. new mexico gets $2.03.
this should be more fair and equitable.
we are not looking for a federal bailout, just federal fairness.
californians carry a special burden since we are a border state.
the federal government alone controls immigration policy. it alone controls border security.
while acknowledging its responsibility, the federal government is not even funding a 50-50 split of the costs of undocumented immigrants.
we can no longer ignore what is owed to us, or what we are forced to spend on federal mandates.
we are currently owed billions of dollars by the federal government for various programs.
we need to work with the feds so that we can fix the flawed formula that demands that states spend money they do not have.
now congress is about to pile billions more onto california with the new health care bill.
while i enthusiastically support health care reform, it is not reform to push more costs onto states that are already struggling while other states get sweetheart deals.
health care reform, which started as noble and needed legislation, has become a trough of bribes, deals and loopholes.
you've heard of the bridge to nowhere. this is health care to nowhere.
california's congressional delegation should either vote against this bill that is a disaster for california or get in there and fight for the same sweetheart deal senator nelson of nebraska got for the cornhusker state. he got the corn; we got the husk.
now, another priority relating to the budget is pension reform.
the cost for state employee pensions is up 2,000 percent in the last ten years, while revenues have only increased by 24 percent.
the pension fund will not have enough money to cover this amount, so the state--that means the taxpayer--has to come up with the money.
this is money that is taken away from important government services.
this is money that cannot go to our universities, our parks and other government functions.
now, for current employees these pensions cannot be changed--either legally or morally.
we cannot break the promises we already made. it is a done deal.
but we are about to get run over by a locomotive. we can see the light coming at us.
i ask the legislature to join me in finding the equivalent of a water deal on pensions, so that we can meet current promises and yet reduce the burden going forward.
these are serious issues we face.
every year, in spite of whatever challenges are before us, i stand up here and tell you how much i believe in california's future.
i tell you how much i believe in the dream.
some people think, "ya, ya, ya, that's just arnold being optimistic."
but i am not alone in believing these things.
time magazine recently did an article about california that sounded like one of my speeches.
i would like to read you a few sentences. time wrote:
"california is still a dream state. in fact, the pioneering megastate...is still the cutting edge of the american future--economically, environmentally, demographically, culturally, and maybe politically.
it is the greenest and the most diverse state, the most globalized...when the world is heading in all those directions.
it's also an unparalleled engine of innovation, the mecca of high tech, biotech and now clean tech.
in 2008, california's wipeout economy attracted more venture capital than the rest of the nation combined."
so... now do you believe me?
california has the means and the mindpower to solve its problems.
sometimes we are just too close to the problems to see the positives, and we need to step back.
a couple months ago i was in iraq visiting our men and women in uniform, and of course many of them were from california.
they have seen and experienced some hard things.
many have served tour after tour after tour. as a result, some have lost homes, spouses, limbs and lives.
too often our soldiers bring back the enemy with them in their heads.
we are seeing a lot of post traumatic stress syndrome. the suicide rate is disturbing.
california has more returning veterans than any other state, so our state, as well as the federal government, has a special responsibility.
you will see that in our agenda.
we have a fundamental obligation to anyone who has shed or risked blood for this country.
that is a priority.
their sacrifice is extraordinary and never fails to inspire me.
and if you look to the gallery, you will see some californians wearing the uniform of our country who have just returned from iraq and afghanistan.
to each of you, i say, "welcome home."
no matter how big the problems are that this state faces, no matter how harsh things may seem to us in the months ahead those californians in uniform will tell you that this is still the greatest place to come home to, the greatest place to pursue a better life.
just ask them how often they dreamed of being back home here in the golden state.
ladies and gentlemen, in closing, we in this chamber must fulfill our sacred trust to keep california a great place to come home to, for our men and women in uniform and for generations of californians yet to come.
thank you very much.

be different. only way to make impossible possible is to try it. if you fail, so what that's what everyone expects, but if you succeed, you make the world a much better place. never follow the crowd. it's easy to stand out when you aim straight for the top.

what do you think of this recall? mr. schwarzenegger.

i think that it is a great idea and i thank god every day that we have hiram johnson, that's created this, you know, more than 90 years ago. his intention was to create this recall, because of special interests controlling politicians and this is exactly what is the case today. and 1.6 million people have signed the recall petition. they basically have said we're mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore. and the 60 percent of the people have said in the polls that they want to have a recall. so it is terrific. the people's will is being acted out.

i think that our top priority right now should be to turn the economy around. we have the worst economic atmosphere, the worst business atmosphere in california. and what we see is because of the businesses are leaving the state and jobs are leaving the state, and we're having the highest workers' compensation costs. we have the highest energy costs here. we have the worst business money management. we have the worst credit rating. we have all of those things that drive businesses away. and we are overregulated, overtaxed and overburdening our businesses. and so no matter where i go in the state, it is the same thing, that workers' compensation is killing businesses. and we have to stop and reverse that.

but cruz, you're painting a wrong picture. 

everything is not fine and dandy here in california. you know that.... 

the reform that you guys just did was total preelection bogus, and you know that. because this all trickery just like the budget was, it was trickery. this is a trick again before--you wanted to put wool over the people eyes.

let me just tell you, that the next year you say this reform, but the worker's compensation costs are going to go up. this is not what's going to help our businesses in california. our businesses are moving away because we're not competitive in worker's compensation. there is tremendous fraud here and all those kind of things. what we have to do is create--when i go to office, i'll create real worker's compensation. cut the costs in half. that's what we need to do. i visited companies here in california. i visited the farmers and the small companies, big companies, vendors and all this stuff. every one is saying the same thing. that are worker's compensation is way too high. we're paying three times the amount of the national average. 

i think it's ridiculous for cruz and arianna to say everything is fine and dandy. and everything is prefect. 

let me tell you something. we have never seen a situation like this. $38.2 billion budget deficit. we just found out that the operating deficit, this is the operating deficit went up to $10 billion. there's so much... 

you have to be honest with the people. remember one thing, in california, we have a three strike system. you guys pull the wool over the people's eyes, twice, the third time you are out you are out. on october 7 you guys are out. 

i like that. arianna, let me say one thing. you personally--your personal income tax have the biggest loophole. i can drive my hummer through it, that's how big loophole is. let me tell you something, i don't know what you're talking about. i cannot believe you. 

the politicians--the politicians make a mistake. they keep spending and spending and spending

then when they realize they made a mistake and they spend the money they don't even have, then go out and go and tax, tax, tax. that's the answer to the problem? 

what you have to do is you put the spending cap on it. 

you guys have an addiction problem. you should go to an addiction place because you cannot--you cannot stop spending. so what happens then is if you spend, then you have tax, tax, tax. i mean, all of a sudden you say, where are the jobs? gone, gone, gone. that's the problem that we're facing here. 

you keep talking about bush. if you want to campaign against bush, go to new hampshire.

you're in the wrong state right now. 

and maybe a little but more decaf.

you talk about bush and all this stuff. let's talk about california. 

what's your solution to california's health care problem, mr. schwarzenegger? 

well, first of all, it is very important to have it available. that we have as many companies bidding so that the prices coming down and make it available. what cruz is suggesting, that again, health care and have the companies pay for it, they cannot do it right now. we have a really a crisis here with our companies with our, you know, businesses because they're overburdened as it is right now with worker's compensation and with med-cal and with all those kinds of things--high electricity costs. they are much, much higher than anywhere in the nation.

they cannot afford it. what you will have then is, you will have no jobs, no businesses, and no health care. what we have to do right now is protect the businesses and protect the people so that they have jobs. that's what we need to do. 

but let me just say something, cruz. it doesn't surprise me that it comes from you. you have never run a business. i'm the only one here that run businesses. developed businesses. 

and met the payroll and has paid for worker's compensation and has taken care of the health care for the employees and stuff like that. you have never done that so it's easy for you to sit there, because you're only used to signing the check on the back. but not the front. you have never signed a check on the front. so, this is what you have to do. realize that. 

well, first of all, i think it's important that we take care of our children. we have to make sure that every child in california is insured. that is the most important thing. i'm very passionate about children's issues. i think that we have to take care of our children and our seniors. that is very important. because they cannot fend for themselves.

the children, we have a healthy family program here in california. it's a very, very good program. it's supposed to insure people to get health care, for children and also for their parents if they're low-income people.

the only problem with the program right now is only two-thirds of the people that are eligible are not having that health care. and because the government has not done a good job of reaching out and finding the people and letting them know to sign up and to find easy ways for them to sign up. two-thirds of the people that are eligible do not have the health care. and so that is really terrible.

if i become governor here, i will immediately go out there and promote that. promote it, and market it and get it out there, so everyone knows about it and everyone signs up, because we must insure our families, the low-income families, especially the children.

well, on that, we do agree. 

arianna, again, as usual, you are off here. we're talking about health care, and you're talking about driver's licenses. 

the governor is supposed to represent the people of california, not special interests. that is the problem here.

arianna, there is no identification, there is no background check. it is dangerous for our security here. 

but let's do it the right way. let's get them visas. let's get them temporary working permits. 

let's get them permanent working permits.

i think it is very important that we preach and we practice tolerance, equality for everyone. it starts with education. this is why i got involved with after-school programs in the inner cities. i started the inner city games after-school programs that are now nationwide and we are reaching out to 200,000 children.

because i feel very strongly that the kids in the inner cities get disadvantaged with education, especially just recently when our governor and cruz bustamante has cut $120 million in textbooks which is supposed to be for those inner city schools, which is unfair. 

it is the same administration. it is the same mold. i mean, don't tell me otherwise here. 

let me just tell you, we need to make sure that our kids get great education, education everywhere, and this is what i'm fighting for. it is the same thing on the job market. we have to have--the people have to have the same right for work and the same kind of opportunities. right now, for instance, we have a 6.6 percent unemployment rate here in california, and we have an increase in unemployment amongst women, 25 percent, amongst hispanics, 20 percent, and amongst african-americans, 45 percent. where is the equality here? we need to fight for equality. i will fight for that. when i am governor, i will fight for that. and i think the governor sets the tone on that. we need equality in this thing.

...no toilets there that are flushing... 

...the paint is peeling off. if you call this equality in education, i think it's outrageous. you know what you guys do, you politicians...

you go into the classroom, you do the photo op, you do the photo op, and then you leave and then we never see you again. 

i am there all the time, because i am providing the after school programs, cruz, and you know that.

first of all, our after school programs, like i told you already, are providing after school programs for 200,000 kids. proposition 49 was the responsible way of going about it to get after school programs. because what the initiative says is, there's a trigger mechanism, only when the state makes an additional $1.5 billion in revenue, then the program can get funded. right now we have a financial crisis, that's why it's not getting funded. if the cruz bustamante-davis administration would have done that since the year 2000, with all of the programs, we wouldn't have a budget deficit right now. 

because i don't want to use money from other program. thank you. 

i think that i agree with tom that we have the worst business climate right now anywhere in the nation. and i think that this is what drives businesses and jobs out of the state and i think we have to reverse that. because the only way that we can pay off our inherited debt, which experts are now saying is between $12 billion and $20 billion, and deal with the current operating deficit is by bringing businesses back because if we bring businesses back, then we bring jobs back. when we bring jobs back and the economy is booming, then we create more revenue and then we can afford some of the programs and pay off the debt, which is very important, because we're not going to get any more credit now the way things are going right now. 

i think it's very important that we have a good relationship between the local and the state government. right now, it doesn't really make much sense. i think that, first of all, that the local government should continue with the services they're providing right now, but it is wrong for the states to go there and take half of the property tax away and then to have the cities and the local government go up and lobby in sacramento continuously to get the money back.

i think that they know best how to spend the money. the local people down at the ground know which programs they need, how to improve education. each one of the communities have different needs. i think they should continue with the services. if it's job training or if it is drug rehabilitation programs or the services that provide with police and fire department, all of those kinds of things. but they should have their own way of funding those programs. 

let me make one thing clear, peter. on october 8, it's not going to be governor wilson or governor bush or any of those kinds of things. it's going to be governor arnold okay? so let's make that clear. thank you.

when you were waiting an hour and a half to do a photo op with me, was that the day? 

you can increase all you want but you will be having empty buildings out there. there will be no companies left. they will be moving to the next state. so, you will have nothing. you will not have accomplished the goals. 

i am for proposition 53. i think it's a good beginning. but the fact of the matter is that we need a lot of infrastructure here in california. infrastructure with the highways and with the transportation, the railroads, infrastructure with our water supply, infrastructure with our ports. we need that. we should model ourselves after texas. in texas, they've committed $140 billion for infrastructure. they are going to start now with building 4,000 miles of transportation, railway, freeways, highways and all those kinds of things.

they have already taken the position we were first in export, now it's texas is first in export, because they are really aggressive, it seems. that's what california ought to do.

hello everyone. it is a tremendous honor to address the 124th annual conservative party conference.
i am sorry i could not join you in person.
but we are in the middle of a special session of the legislature that i called, to address two of the biggest issues facing california.
one is comprehensive health care reform and the other is a long-term water plan to make sure california has all the water it needs to remain prosperous for generations to come.
so i had to cancel all travel except a long-term promise to attend the special olympics world summer games in china in a few days.
but i am happy to talk with you via satellite because as someone from europe who now lives in america, i have a profound appreciation of the bond between our two nations.
no matter the challenge, no matter the issue, americans know you have always been our trusted and valued friend.
and i suspect you feel the same way about us.
it's fantastic you found such a great new keynote speaker, my good friend and soul mate, mayor michael bloomberg.
now i have to say that because just like your dynamic leader david cameron, the mayor always puts the people first.
he knows, like david cameron and i know, that we are public servants, not party servants.
and that our job is to recognize the issues that matter to the people the most and to solve them.
issues we are all working on very hard in california, new york city and in great britain.
issues like health care, balanced budgets, economic development, education reform, public safety, infrastructure and of course global warming and protecting the environment.
these are not conservative or liberal issues. they are issues everyone cares about.
people want quality health care, no matter what party they belong to.
they want safe communities, no matter what party they belong to.
they want a healthy environment, no matter what party they belong to.
think about global warming, which your party has done such great work on.
we are changing the dynamic. last year, after i signed our landmark climate change bill, everyone was inspired by california's leadership on this vital issue.
mayor bloomberg did the same thing in april by proposing his green plan for new york city, the most ambitious environmental blueprint for a city in history.
and by being a strong and forceful voice on climate change, david cameron has revived your conservative party's green heritage and helped strengthen britain's resolve to set an example on this issue.
that is the kind of leadership people are hungry for. they want action and results, not ideology and stalemate.
they prefer progress with messy compromise, over defeat with pristine principles.
"the pessimist sees difficulty in every opportunity," winston churchill once said.
"the optimist sees opportunity in every difficulty."
i agree 100 percent.
i know david cameron and michael bloomberg do, too.
thank you very much. and now let me introduce to you one of the greatest mayors ever, my friend, michael bloomberg.
 
what can that baby possibly need?

they grow out of things faster than you can ever imagine. my wife is out there all the time shopping because the shoes are too small all of a sudden, or the little outfit is too small, or the pants are too tight.

 and you've got a sequel coming to the terminator, a film that did a lot of things for you.

 pumping iron was a good vehicle for me. conan the barbarian was a good vehicle for me. but terminator, which came three years after that, was a great vehicle. it took me from the conan-like parts that were being offered to me because of my body, which of course i understood because that was my big asset then, and created good box office. and that sent a whole new signal out to the community. you know, this is a town of copying. there are only a few original ideas that everyone else runs and copies. i think terminator made people think. it was understood that i had the body, but i didn't have to show it to make a point.

 this time there's another terminator who's badder than you. was it a concerted decision not to have you play the film's villain this time?

 we talked about having me playing the good guy and the bad guy. that is, we would have had two terminators with two different missions. both look alike, but when they were taken off the rack they were programmed differently and then sent to the past. we played around with that idea, but the more we talked about it, the more i think jim felt the new terminator should be a streamlined-looking character. it should be the opposite to me. very lean.

 another twist is that your character becomes somewhat humanized.

  there are certain feelings that i begin to understand by observing human beings. there is a wonderful scene where the boy who plays linda hamilton's son cries, and i say, "what's wrong with your eyes?" later on i tell him that i have come to understand crying, though it is something i could never do. i talk about emotions that suddenly register.

 we all know that you work on your body and your business dealings, but what do you do as an actor to make yourself better? do you take classes?

 in the last two years i've gone from one movie to the next, and i haven't had time to take classes, though i took them beforehand. i think the best practice you can get-the thing that makes you feel most comfortable and grow as an actor-is to work with different directors and different talented actors. it's on-the-job training. the things i have always worked on are the accent and the movement. not that i want to get rid of the accent completely, because it has become a trademark, a signature.

 was kindergarten cop an important step for you?

 i loved kindergarten cop. it was one of the few times when i could look at a movie of mine and say that i think that my performance was good. i believed myself in it, and that's hard for me to do.

 you took some heat on that film because of its mix of little kids and violence.

 i took heat, the film took heat, ivan took heat. you can never dissociate yourself when there is heat. you can't say, i had nothing to do with it, and then when someone else says it was the greatest thing say, yeah, this is me. you have to take the responsibility both ways. i, of course, felt the arguments against the film were totally unjustifiable. we made a really conscious effort not to be violent. but what made the film different was that it told the story of this tough cop who's thrown into this situation where none of his tough tactics work. through that you got into comedy and a serious story-i think it was done as softly as it could be done with that idea. people were right when they said, i don't want to take my four-year-old kid to this movie. well, it was rated pg-13, so there was no confusion there.

 do you think that the controversy hurt the movie?

 absolutely. i would say $25 million worth. it should have reached the exact same audience as twins, which made over $110 million; kindergarten cop made $85 million.

 in terminator 2 you go through quite a metamorphosis.

 yeah, i go through a series of changes. in the final stage my body is shot up. the chest is open, and you can see the steel coming through. the mechanism of the knee is exposed, and the flesh is hanging out. half the flesh of my face is gone. needless to say, i'm a big mess. i'm also totally wiped out after the five hours of makeup it takes to get to this stage.

 what do you do during those five hours?

 you can't read, because they're working on your face. so i use the time to do a lot of my work. my secretary reads letters to me and newspapers and the trades and clippings i get from the council on fitness office. i'm obsessed with packing in as much work as possible during each day, simply because there is only so much time you have in a lifetime. there is nothing better than to go home at night and know that you've done everything that you could do to accomplish your work.

 you take your position as chairman of the president's council on physical fitness and sports very seriously, don't you?

  yes, because i think the key things we have for our youth are academic education and physical education. and we must make those two things work together. and i take the academic education as seriously as the physical education. that's why i tell parents that the schools can't do it all themselves. the parents can't come home from work and turn on the tv. that's not being a good parent. if you look at statistics and see that the average american watches four to six hours of tv a day, then you know they can take half an hour of their time to work with their children. you have to challenge the parents all the time, and also the schools.

 you're traveling to all the states to discuss physical education, right?

 yes, i will eventually get to all 50 of them. the idea is to work state by state and on a national level. luckily we have a president who is a physical-education fanatic. so i have a big ally there.

 what's your own exercise regimen like?

 one hour a day. weights and the lifecycle. or weights and running, or weights and the rowing machine. it varies. i might hike three or four miles. my regimen is different today because i'm trying not to be so big. i train with lighter weights; i train faster. i do more cardiovascular training to stay slim. i try to stay around 215.

 how many hours of sleep do you need each night? your days seem to be awfully busy.

 some nights i sleep only three or four hours, or maybe not at all, but mostly six hours. there are times when i shoot all night and then, on saturday morning, have to fly to washington, d.c., or to some state to discuss fitness. but you cannot get tired if you're interested in what you do. that's the key thing. when i see those two thousand kids in front of me, and their parents and teachers, and the governor... well, it's the same as when i was in training, in bodybuilding. you train five hours a day, as i did when i was competing, and people say, my god, you're so disciplined. but it has nothing to do with discipline; i loved it. because i knew that every time i went to the gym i was one step closer to winning the competition.
